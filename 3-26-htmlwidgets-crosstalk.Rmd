# Linking Widgets {#linking-widgets}

Widgets can be linked with one another using the crosstalk [@R-crosstalk] package, a fantastic add-on for htmlwidgets that implements inter-widget interactions, namely selection and filtering. This in effect allows the selection or filtering of data points in one widget to be mirrored in another. This is enabled with the creation of "shared datasets" that can be used across widgets; outputs that share datasets share interactions.

Crosstalk provides a straightforward interface to the users and instead requires effort from developers for their widgets to support shared datasets.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(crosstalk)

arcs <- jsonlite::fromJSON(
  '[
    {
      "e": "CN",
      "i": "US",
      "v": 3300000
    },
    {
      "e": "CN",
      "i": "RU",
      "v": 10000
    }
  ]'
)
```

## Crosstalk examples

Both the plotly and DT packages support crosstalk, therefore using a shared dataset we can produce a scatter plot with the former and a table with the latter so that selection of data in one is reflected in the other.

As alluded to earlier on this can be achieved by using a shared dataset which can be created with the `SharedData` R6 class from the crosstalk package, this dataset is then used as one would use a standard dataframe in plotly and DT. The `bscols` function is just a helper to create columns from html elements (using bootstrap). It's ideal for examples but one should not have to use it in Shiny---crosstalk will work without `bscols`.

```r
library(DT)
library(plotly)
library(crosstalk)

shared <- SharedData$new(cars)

bscols(
  plot_ly(shared, x = ~speed, y=~dist),
  datatable(shared, width = "100%")
)
```

![Crosstalk Example](images/crosstalk.png)

Basic usage of crosstalk datasets in shiny is also straightforward since it accepts reactive expressions to create shared datasets. Note that it takes the expression itself (`reactive`) not the output of the expression (`expression()`), the crosstalk documentation explains it best:

> If this feels foreign to you, think of how you pass a function name, not a function call, to `lapply`; that’s exactly analogous to what we’re doing here. 
> 
> --- Official Crosstalk documentation

```r
library(DT)
library(shiny)
library(plotly)
library(crosstalk)

ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput(
    "specie", "Specie", 
    choices = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica")
  ),
  fluidRow(
    column(6, DTOutput("table")),
    column(6, plotlyOutput("plot"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  reactive_data <- reactive({
    iris[iris$Species == input$specie, ]
  })

  sd <- SharedData$new(reactive_data)

  output$table <- renderDT({
    datatable(sd)
  }, server = FALSE)

  output$plot <- renderPlotly({
    plot_ly(sd, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Sepal.Width)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{block, type='rmdnote'}
Create the shared dataset in the server function or some things that follow might not work as expected.
```

One can also use the `data` method on the crosstalk object in reactive expressions, which allows accessing the Javascript selection where crosstalk is not directly supported, like below in a custom UI block. Note that the argument `withSelection` is set to `TRUE` in order to retrieve the selection state of the rows. 

```r
library(DT)
library(shiny)
library(crosstalk)

ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(4, uiOutput("text")),
    column(8, DTOutput("table"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  sd <- SharedData$new(cars)

  output$text <- renderUI({
    # get selected rows
    n_selected <- sd$data(withSelection = TRUE) %>% 
      dplyr::filter(selected_ == TRUE) %>% 
      nrow()

    h3(n_selected, "selected items")
    
  })

  output$table <- renderDT({
    datatable(sd)
  }, server = FALSE)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![Shiny with crosstalk](images/crosstalk-shiny.png)

Using crosstalk with shiny one can also change the selection server-side with the `selection` method, passing it the keys to select.

```r
library(DT)
library(shiny)
library(crosstalk)

ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(4, actionButton("random", "Select a random row")),
    column(8, DTOutput("table"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  sd <- SharedData$new(cars)

  output$table <- renderDT({
    datatable(sd)
  }, server = FALSE)

  selected <- c()
  observeEvent(input$random, {
    smp <- c(1:50)[!1:50 %in% selected]
    selected <<- append(selected, sample(smp, 1))
    sd$selection(selected)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Crosstalk requirements

Crosstalk is will not work well with every widget and every dataset, in some cases it might not even be a good idea to support it at all.

Crosstalk works best on rectangular data: dataframes or objects that resemble dataframes like `tibble` or `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`. This is important as crosstalk will treat the data rowwise, where each row is an observation that is ultimately selected, or filtered. If the underlying data is not tabular (e.g.: trees) then one might eventually encounter mismatches between widgets as they go out of sync.

Other than tabular data, crosstalk will require the widget to have the necessary functions or methods to dispatch the selection and filtering that crosstalk enables, that is, the widget must be able to filter as well as highlight and fade selected data points as crosstalk itself does not provide this, neither the JavaScript nor the interface tools.

## How it works

As will be discovered later when support for crosstalk is brought to gio, very little changes on the R side. As might be expected, crosstalk enables communication between widgets via JavaScript, hence much of what must be adapted by widgets developers happens in JavaScript too.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph G {

  graph [compound=true rankdir = LR]
  node [shape=record fontsize=10];

  # r stuff
  subgraph cluster_1 { 
    'Widget 1' 'Widget 2';
    label = 'JavaScript';
    color=gold;
  }

  # js
  subgraph cluster_0 {
    node [width = 0.9]
    Dataframe 'Shared Dataset'; 
    label='R';
    color=royalBlue;
  }

  'Dataframe' -> 'Shared Dataset';
  'Widget 1' -> 'Widget 2' [dir=both color=dimGray];

  # connect subgraphs
  'Shared Dataset' -> 'Widget 1' [lhead=cluster_1 ltail=cluster_0];
}
", width = "100%", height = 250)
```

Indeed the bi-directional communication between widgets works in the RStudio viewer, R markdown, Shiny and elsewhere, clearly indicating that all of it is taking place in the browser. This internally works with `key`s that are assigned to every row of the dataframe which enable crosstalk to track which are selected or filtered. These keys can be explicitly set by the user and otherwise default to the row names of the data.frame, and if these are not available the `SharedData` function will create row numbers.

```{r}
# assign keys
df <- data.frame(x = runif(26))
sd <- SharedData$new(df, key = letters)
```

In a sense, while crosstalk establishes lines of communication to transport `key`s between widgets, developers of the respective widgets must handle what `key`s are sent and what to do with incoming `key`s. There are two such lines of communication, one for `key`s of rows that are meant to be filtered meant to narrow down the selection of data points displayed on a widget, and another for selection (what crosstalk refers to as "linked brushing") to highlight certain data points.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph G {

  subgraph cluster_g1 {
    node [shape=record fontsize=7]
    d1 [label='Dataset']
    d3 [label='Dataset']
    k1 [label='Keys']
    label='Group 1'
    fontsize=9
    color=royalBlue
  }

  subgraph cluster_g2 {
    node [shape=record fontsize=7]
    d2 [label='Dataset'] 
    k2 [label='Keys']
    label='Group 2'
    fontsize=9
    color=royalBlue
  }

  node [shape=record fontsize=7 color=gold]
  w1 [label='widget 1']
  w2 [label='widget 2']
  w3 [label='widget 3']
  w4 [label='widget 4']
  w5 [label='widget 5']

  w1 -> k1 [dir=both arrowsize=.5]
  w2 -> k1 [dir=both arrowsize=.5]
  w3 -> k2 [dir=both arrowsize=.5]
  w4 -> k2 [dir=both arrowsize=.5]
  w5 -> k2 [dir=both arrowsize=.5]

  d2 -> k2 [arrowsize=.5]
  d1 -> k1 [arrowsize=.5]
  d3 -> k1 [arrowsize=.5]

}
", width = "100%", height=250)
```

In JavaScript, a widget "receives" the keys of selected and filtered data points and must, when filtering or selection is observed, "send" said selected or filtered keys to other widgets. Internally crosstalk knows what to share across widgets with `group`s groups share `key`s and are isolated from each other so one can use multiple different shared datasets without them interfering with each other. 

```{block, type='rmdnote'}
Crosstalk groups share keys.
```

Therefore, the code below creates two shared datasets that are linked as they fall in the same `group` despite the fact that they are separate R objects.

```r
# row.name will be used as keys
row.names(mtcars)[1:3]

shared_cars <- SharedData$new(mtcars, group = "cars")
shared_cars_head <- SharedData$new(head(mtcars), group = "cars")
```

This effectively means that the key `Mazda RX4` "means" the same thing in `shared_cars` and `shared_cars_head`.

## Crosstalk with gio

The application of crosstalk to the gio library is somewhat amiss but it makes it rather more instructive. As mentioned before, in order for crosstalk to be properly implemented a widget must be a able to select, deselect as well as filter and unfilter data points and this is not entirely the case of gio. 

First, gio's underlying data is somewhat uncommon: it is a network defined only by its edges (the arcs leaving and coming into countries). Second, those edges themselves cannot be selected, as we've observed previously one cannot truly change what edges are drawn on the globe, only change the selected country which by proxy defines the edges shown on the globe. Third, while gio supports changing which country is selected (by clicking on the globe) it does not allow unselecting a country; with gio.js a country is always selected.

The way crosstalk can work with gio is by setting the keys of the shared dataset to the country ISO codes that gio uses. Since data gio accepts consists of edges this ISO code could correspond to either the source or the target country.

```{r}
# keys = target
shared_arcs <- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$e)
# keys = source
shared_arcs <- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$i)
```

This constraint would have to be documented and communicated to the users of the package as otherwise gio's implementation of crosstalk will not work.

Were the constraint of having to specify the keys removed the gio package would have to interpret the keys. For instance, the widget would receive a selection, say `3` indicating that the third edge was selected in another widget, gio, not being able to highlight the edge, would have decide whether to highlight either the country where the edge comes from or the country where the edge goes to. Though this could be implemented it would be vastly more laborious and in fact be more limited as the choice of country to highlight would no longer up to the user.

## Adapt the R code

In any event, let us start by making the required changes to the R code first. The only changes that need to be made are in the `gio` function as it is the only that currently accepts a data object and thus may receive a shared dataset.

```{r}
class(shared_arcs)
```

Shared datasets are R6 classes and therefore cannot simply be treated as dataframes. The `gio` function needs to check whether the `data` object it received is a shared dataset with `is.SharedData` and if so use its methods to extract data from it, namely:

- The original dataset with `origData`.
- The group to which the dataset belongs with `groupName`.
- The keys that were assigned to every row of the dataset with `key`

The `origData` method is needed to extract the data from the shared dataset. This is of course necessary as the `gio` function still needs to obtain and serialise the arcs to display on the globe.

```{r}
# original data
shared_arcs$origData()
```

The `gio` function also has to extract the group to which the dataset belongs, this will be necessary JavaScript-side to tell crosstalk which group one is working with. Note that it was randomly generated since none were specified when the shared dataset was created.

```{r}
# groupName
shared_arcs$groupName()

# keys
shared_arcs$key()
```

The methods `origData` and `groupName` must be used in every widget, the `key` method may not be useful with every widget, it can be immensely useful if the visualisation library also comes with a key/id system so one can use it internally, as explored previously gio.js does not and we thus will not be using it. The name of the group is passed to the `x` object so it is accessible JavaScript-side where it is needed, we also add the JavaScript dependency required to run crosstalk with `crosstalkLibs`.

```r
gio <- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL, 
  elementId = NULL) {

  # defaults to NULL
  group <- NULL

  # uses crosstalk
  if (crosstalk::is.SharedData(data)) {
    group <- data$groupName()
    data <- data$origData()
  }

  # forward options using x
  x = list(
    data = data,
    style = "default",
    crosstalk = list(group = group) # pass group
  )

  attr(x, 'TOJSON_ARGS') <- list(dataframe = "rows")

  # create widget
  htmlwidgets::createWidget(
    name = 'gio',
    x,
    width = width,
    height = height,
    package = 'gio',
    elementId = elementId,
    sizingPolicy = htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy(
      padding = 0,
      browser.fill = TRUE,
      defaultWidth = "100%"
    ),
    preRenderHook = render_gio,
    # add crosstalk dependency
    dependencies = crosstalk::crosstalkLibs()
  )
}
```

While this is outside the scope of the book, it would be slightly more efficient to use a method instead of an if statement as above so that the crosstalk dependency is only loaded when a shared dataset is used, the function above would include the dependencies regardless making the output slight larger.

## Change the JavaScript code

What is left to do is to adapt the JavaScript code, as a reminder it must accept the keys selected in other widgets and share the selected key with other widgets.

First we create the selection handler in the `factory` function, this is done by instantiating a new class from `crosstalk.SelectionHandle`.

```js
var sel_handle = new crosstalk.SelectionHandle();
```

Once the selection handle created it can be used in the `renderValue` function to set the group that was collected from R.

```js
sel_handle.setGroup(x.crosstalk.group);
```

### Send selected keys

In order for gio to share share the selected country with other widgets it would first have to know which country is selected. This can be achieved with a callback function that gio supports.

Most JavaScript visualisation libraries will support callbacks or events that are triggered when the user interacts with the visualisation so one can have arbitrary code run when, for example, a user clicks a point on a scatter plot, or when the user clicks the legend of a chart. What these callback functions will be and how they work will entirely depend on the library at hand. 

In gio.js this callback function is fired when a country is selected on the globe and accepts two objects, one containing data on the country selected and another containing data on the related countries (the arcs coming and leaving the selected country). 

The [documentation of gio.js](https://giojs.org/html/docs/callbackPicked.html) gives the following example callback function.

```js
// define callback function
function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) {
  console.log(selectedCountry);
  console.log(relatedCountries);
}

// use callback function
controller.onCountryPicked(callback);
```

This defines a function named `callback` which takes the two aforementioned objects and logs them in the JavaScript console. Then the function is passed to the `controller` which will run it every time a country is picked (selected). This callback function will be useful to send the `key`s to other widgets: when a user selects China send the `CN` key selection.

The callback function that one wants to have run every time a country is picked by the user can be passed to `controller.onCountryPicked`.

Let us first explore the what is within the object `selectedCountry` object by logging it to the console.

```js
// placed in renderValue function

// create callback function
function callback (selectedCountry) {
  console.log(selectedCountry);
}

// pass it to gio.js
controller.onCountryPicked(callback);
```

```json
{name: "LIBYA", lat: 25, lon: 17, center: n, ISOCode: "LY"}
```

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the keys used with the datasets for gio.js should be country ISO codes, therefore one can consider the `ISOCode` variable as selected `key`. The `set` method from the selection handle can be used to share the selected key with other widgets. Note that this method expects either a `null` value or an array a scalar value will throw an error, hence `selectedCountry.ISOCode` is wrapped in square brackets.

```js
function callback (selectedCountry) {
  sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]);
}

controller.onCountryPicked(callback);
```

### Set selected keys

We have implemented the necessary to share the selected country with other widgets but are yet to implemented the opposite; when users select a country in another widget the selected country in gio should change too. 

```js
// placed in factory function
sel_handle.on("change", function(e) {
  console.log(e);
});
```

```json
{
  oldValue: [],
  sender: n {
    _eventRelay: e, 
    _emitter: t, 
    _group: "SharedDatac7682f87", 
    _var: r, 
    _varOnChangeSub: "sub1", 
    …
  },
  value: ["AE"]
}
```

1. `oldValue` - the value that was previously selected (if any), this may be useful if the widget wants to calculate differences between the currently and previously selected value.
2. `sender` - the selection handle instance that made the change. This is useful to compare against the selection handle of the widget and know whether the change in selection was initiated by this widget or another. It is often used to clear the selection or filtering before applying a new one when the change comes from another widget.
3. `value` - the array of selected keys.

Therefore the listening to the change event on the selection would look like this. Note that 1) the selection cannot be cleared with gio.js, a country is always selected, and 2) one can only select one country a time, hence only accepting the first element of the selected keys with `e.value[0]`.

```js
// placed in factory function
sel_handle.on("change", function(e) {
  if (e.sender !== sel_handle) {
    // clear the selection
    // not possible with gio.js
  }
  controller.switchCountry(e.value[0]);
});
```

To recap, this is what the JavaScript code should not look like.

```js
HTMLWidgets.widget({

  name: 'gio',

  type: 'output',

  factory: function(el, width, height) {

    // TODO: define shared variables for this instance
    var controller;

    // create selection handle
    var sel_handle = new crosstalk.SelectionHandle();

    // listen to change
    sel_handle.on("change", function(e) {
      if (e.sender !== sel_handle) {
        // clear selection
      }
      controller.switchCountry(e.value[0]);
    });


    return {

      renderValue: function(x) {

        controller = new GIO.Controller(el);

        // group
        sel_handle.setGroup(x.crosstalk.group);
        
        // add data
        controller.addData(x.data);

        controller.setStyle(x.style);

        // callback
        function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) {
          sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); // send keys
        }

        controller.onCountryPicked(callback);

        // use stats
        if(x.stats)
          controller.enableStats();

        // render
        controller.init();

      },

      resize: function(width, height) {
        controller.resizeUpdate();
      },

    };
  }
});
```

### Using crosstalk with gio

Finally, now that gio supports we can create a few examples to demonstrate how it can be used. 

The simplest way is probably to convert the edges to a shared dataset specifying either the source (`i`) or target (`e`) country codes as keys. However this is unlikely to be used this way out in the real world. In the example below selecting an edge highlights a node which is somewhat confusing.

```r
library(DT)
library(gio)
library(crosstalk)

url <- paste0(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCoene/",
  "javascript-for-r/master/data/countries.json"
)
arcs <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url)

# Wrap data frame in SharedData
# key is importing country
sd <- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$i)

bscols(
  gio(sd),
  datatable(sd, width="100%", selection = "single")
)
```

![Gio with DT using crosstalk](images/crosstalk-gio-1.png)

Thankfully we can use the `group` argument in order to create edges and nodes that share keys and produce a more sensible linkage. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph {

  graph[rankdir = TB]

  subgraph cluster_0 {
    label='sharedGroup'
    node [shape=record fontsize=10];
    edges_sd nodes_sd
    keys [color=royalBlue]
    color=dimGray
  }

  node [shape=record fontsize=10 color=gold];
  gio plotly

  edges_sd -> keys [arrowsize=.5];
  nodes_sd -> keys [arrowsize=.5];

  gio -> keys [dir=both arrowsize=.5];
  plotly -> keys [dir=both arrowsize=.5 constraint=false];
}
", width="100%")
```

Below we create two shared datasets with the same group name, one for the edges and another for the nodes and use one for the gio visualisation and the other for the plotly graph.

```r
library(gio)
library(plotly)
library(crosstalk)

url <- paste0(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCoene/",
  "javascript-for-r/master/data/countries.json"
)
arcs <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url)

# Wrap data frame in SharedData
edges_sd <- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$i, group = "sharedGroup")

# create nodes
iso2c <- unique(arcs$i)
nodes <- data.frame(
  country = iso2c,
  y = rnorm(length(iso2c))
)
nodes_sd <- SharedData$new(
  nodes, key = nodes$country, 
  group = "sharedGroup"
)

bscols(
  plot_ly(data = nodes_sd, type = "bar", x = ~country, y = ~y) %>% 
    config(displayModeBar = FALSE),
  gio(edges_sd)
)
```
