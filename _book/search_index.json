Photo by Cody Davis on Unsplash The R programming language has seen the integration of many languages; C, C++, Python, to name a few, can be seamlessly embedded into R so one can easily call code written in other languages from the R console. Little known to many, R works just as well with JavaScript—this book delves into the various ways both languages can work together. The ultimate aim of this work is to demonstrate to the reader the many great benefits one can reap by inviting JavaScript into their data science workflow. In that respect the book is not teaching one JavaScript but rather demonstrates how little JavaScript can greatly support and enhance R code. Therefore focus is on integrating external JavaScript libraries and only limited knowledge of JavaScript is required in order to learn from the book. Moreover, the book focuses on generalisable learnings so the reader can transfer takeaways from the book to solve real-world problems. Throughout the book several shiny applications and R packages are put together as examples, all of these, along with the code for the entire book can be found on the Github repository: github.com/JohnCoene/javascript-for-r. Premise The R programming language has been propelled into web browsers with the introduction of packages such as shiny (Chang, Cheng, Allaire, et al. 2020) and rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2020) which have greatly improved how R users can communicate complex insights by building interactive web applications and interactive documents. Yet most R developers are not familiar with one of web browsers’ core technology: JavaScript. This books aims to remedy to that by revealing how much JavaScript can greatly enhance various stages of data science pipelines from the analysis to the communication of results. Importantly, the focus of the book truly is the integration of JavaScript with R where both languages either actively interact with one another, or where JavaScript enables doing things otherwise not accessible to R users—it is not merely about including JavaScript code that works alongside R. Book Structure The book opens with an introduction to better illustrate its premise, it provides rationales for using JavaScript in conjunction with R which it supports with existing R packages that make use of JavaScript and are available on CRAN. Then it briefly describes concepts essential to understand the rest of the book to ensure the reader can follow along. Finally, this part closes by listing the various methods with which one might make JavaScript work with R. We explore existing integrations of JavaScript and R namely by exploring packages to grasp how these tend to work and the interface to JavaScript they provide. A sizeable part of the book concerns data visualisation, it plunges into creating interactive outputs with the htmlwidgets package. This opens with a brief overview of how it works and libraries that make great candidates to integrate with the htmlwidgets package. Then a first, admittedly unimpressive, widget is built to look under the hood and observe the inner-workings of such outputs in order to grasp a better understanding of how htmlwidgets work. Next, we tackle a more substantial library that allows drawing arcs between countries on a 3D globe. Then, to demonstrate that such packages are not limited to visualisation and more broadly applies to interactive outputs, a second package is built, one that allows to mimic text being typed on the screen. The last two chapter go into more advanced topics such as security and resizing. The fourth part of the book details how JavaScript can work with Shiny. Once the basics out of the way, the second chapter builds the first utility to programmatically display notifications. Then we create a functionality to notify the user when the shiny server is busy running computations. This part of the book ends with an example of custom shiny output for a library that applies filters to images. Finally, shiny and htmlwidgets are (literally) connected by including additional functionalities in interactive visualisations when used with the shiny framework. Finally, we look at how one can use some of the more modern JavaScript technologies such as Vue, React, and webpack with R—these can make the use of JavaScript more agile and robust. Then the book delves into using JavaScript for computations, namely via the V8 engine and node.js. After a short introduction, chapters will walk the reader through various examples: a fuzzy search, a time format converter, and some basic natural language operations. Next the book closes with examples of all the integrations explored previously. This involves recreating (a part of) the plotly package, building an image classifier, adding progress bars to a shiny application, building an app with HTTP cookies and running basic machine learning operations in JavaScript. Finally, the book concludes with some noteworthy remarks on where to go next. Acknowledgement Many people in the R community have inspired me and provided the knowledge to ultimately write this book, amongst them are Ramnath Vaidyanathan for his amazing work on the htmlwidgets (Vaidyanathan et al. 2020) package, Kent Russel from whom I have learned a lot via his work on making Vue and React accessible in R, and Carson Sievert for pioneering probably the most popular integration of R and JavaScript with the plotly (Sievert et al. 2020) package. Early reviewers also shared precious feedback that help make the book dramatically better, thanks to Maya Gans, Felipe Mattioni Maturana, and Wei Su for thoroughly going through every line of the book. References "],["intro-overview.html", "Chapter 1 Overview 1.1 Rationale 1.2 Methods 1.3 Methods Amiss", " Chapter 1 Overview This book starts with a rationale for integrating JavaScript with R and supports it with examples, namely packages that use JavaScript and are available on CRAN. Then, we list the various ways in which one might go about making both languages work together. In the next chapter, we go over prerequisites and a review of concepts fundamental to fully understand the more advanced topics residing in the forthcoming chapters. 1.1 Rationale Why blend two languages seemingly so far removed from each other? Well, precisely because they are fundamentally different languages that each have their strengths and weaknesses, combining the two allows making the most of their consolidated advantages and circumvent their respective limitations to produce software altogether better for it. Nevertheless, a fair reason to use JavaScript might simply be that the thing one wants to achieve in R has already been realised in JavaScript. Why reinvent the wheel when the solution already exists and that it can be made accessible from R? The R package lawn (Chamberlain and Hollister 2020) by Ropensci integrates turf.js, a brilliant library for geo-spatial analysis. JavaScript is by no means required to make those computations, they could be rewritten solely in R but that would be vastly more laborious than wrapping the JavaScript API in R as done by the package lawn. library(lawn) lawn_count(lawn_data$polygons_count, lawn_data$points_count, &quot;population&quot;) #&gt; &lt;FeatureCollection&gt; #&gt; Bounding box: -112.1 46.6 -112.0 46.6 #&gt; No. features: 2 #&gt; No. points: 20 #&gt; Properties: #&gt; values count #&gt; 1 200, 600 2 #&gt; 2 0 Another great reason is that JavaScript can do things that R cannot, e.g.: run in the browser. Therefore one cannot natively create interactive visualisations with R. Plotly (Sievert et al. 2020) by Carson Sievert packages the plotly JavaScript library to let one create interactive visualisations solely from R code. library(plotly) plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, color = ~clarity, width = &quot;100%&quot;) Finally, JavaScript can work together with R to improve how we communicate insights. One of the many ways in which Shiny stands out is that it lets one create web applications solely from R code with no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript but that does not mean they can’t extend Shiny, quite the contrary. The waiter package (Coene 2020b) integrates a variety of JavaScript libraries to display loading screens in Shiny applications. library(shiny) library(waiter) ui &lt;- fluidPage( use_waiter(), # include dependencies actionButton(&quot;show&quot;, &quot;Show loading for 3 seconds&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ # create a waiter w &lt;- Waiter$new() # on button click observeEvent(input$show, { w$show() Sys.sleep(3) w$hide() }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 1.1: Waiter screen Hopefully this makes a couple of great reasons and alluring examples to entice the reader to persevere with this book. 1.2 Methods Though perhaps not obvious at first, all of the packages used as examples in the previous section interfaced with R very differently. As we’ll discover, there many ways in which one can blend JavaScript with R, generally the way to go about it is dictated by the nature of what is to be achieved. Let’s list the methods available to us to blend JavaScript with R before covering them each in-depth in their own respective chapter later in the book. 1.2.1 V8 V8 by Jeroen Ooms is an R interface to Google’s JavaScript engine. It will let you run JavaScript code directly from R and get the result back, it even comes with an interactive console. This is the way the lawn package used in a previous example internally interfaces with the turf.js library. library(V8) #&gt; Using V8 engine 6.8.275.32-node.55 ctx &lt;- v8() ctx$eval(&quot;2 + 2&quot;) # this is evaluated in JavaScript! #&gt; [1] &quot;4&quot; 1.2.2 htmlwidgets htmlwidgets (Vaidyanathan et al. 2020) specialises in wrapping JavaScript libraries that generate visual outputs. This is what packages such as plotly, DT (Xie, Cheng, and Tan 2020), highcharter (Kunst 2020), and many more use to provide interactive visualisation with R. It is by far the most popular integration out there, at the time of writing this it has been downloaded nearly 10 million times from CRAN. It will therefore be covered extensively in later chapters. 1.2.3 Shiny The Shiny framework allows creating applications accessible from web browsers where JavaScript natively runs, it follows that JavaScript can run alongside such applications. Often overlooked though, the two can also work hand-in-hand as one can pass data from the R server to the JavaScript front-end and vice versa. This is how the package waiter mentioned previously internally works with R. 1.3 Methods Amiss Note that there are also two other prominent ways one can use JavaScript with R that are not covered in this book. The main reason being that they require great knowledge of specific JavaScript libraries, d3.js and React, and while these are themselves advanced uses of JavaScript, their integration with R via the packages listed below is rather straightforward. 1.3.1 reactR &amp; vueR ReactR (Inc et al. 2020) is an R package that emulates very well htmlwidgets but specifically for the React framework. Unlike htmlwidgets it is not limited to visual outputs and also provides functions to build inputs, e.g.: a drop-down menu (like shiny::selectInput). The reactable package (Lin 2020) uses reactR to enable building interactive tables solely from R code. reactable::reactable(iris[1:5, ], showPagination = TRUE) There is also the package vueR (You and Russell 2020) which brings some of Vue.js to R. 1.3.2 r2d3 r2d3 (Luraschi and Allaire 2018) by RStudio is an R package designed specifically to work with d3.js. It is similar to htmlwidgets but works rather differently. # https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/articles/gallery/chord/ r2d3::r2d3( data = matrix(round(runif(16, 1, 10000)), ncol = 4, nrow = 4), script = &quot;chord.js&quot; ) References "],["prerequisites.html", "Chapter 2 Prerequisites 2.1 R Package Development 2.2 JSON 2.3 JavaScript 2.4 Shiny", " Chapter 2 Prerequisites The code contained in the following pages is approachable to readers with basic knowledge of R, but familiarity with package development using devtools (Wickham, Hester, and Chang 2020), the Shiny framework (Chang, Cheng, Allaire, et al. 2020), the JSON data format, and JavaScript are essential. The reason for the former is that some of the ways one builds integrations with JavaScript naturally take the form of R packages. Also, R packages make sharing code, datasets, and anything else R-related extremely convenient, they come with a relatively strict structure, the ability to run unit tests, and much more. These have thus become a core feature of the R ecosystem and therefore are also used extensively in the book as we create several packages. The following section thus runs over the essentials of building a package to ensure everyone can keep up. Then we briefly go through the JSON data format as it will be used to a great extent to communicate between R and JavaScript. Since both Shiny and JavaScript run in the browser they make for axiomatic companions; we’ll therefore use Shiny extensively. Finally, there is an obligatory short introduction to JavaScript. It is highly recommended to use the freely available RStudio IDE to follow along as it makes a lot of things easier down the line. 2.1 R Package Development Developing packages used to be notoriously difficult but things have greatly changed in recent years, namely thanks to the devtools (Wickham, Hester, and Chang 2020), roxygen2 (Wickham, Danenberg, et al. 2020) and more recent usethis (Wickham and Bryan 2020) packages. Devtools is short for “developer tools,” it is specifically designed to help creating packages; setting up tests, running checks, building and installing packages, etc. The second provides an all too convenient way to generate the documentation of packages, and usethis, more broadly helps setting up projects, and automating repetitive tasks. Here, we only skim over the fundamentals, there is an entire book by Hadley Wickham called R Packages solely dedicated to the topic. Start by installing those packages from CRAN, the roxygen2 package does not need to be explicitly installed as it is a dependency of devtools. install.packages(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;usethis&quot;)) 2.1.1 Creating a Package There are multiple ways to create a package. One could manually create every file, use the RStudio IDE, or create it from the R console with the usethis (Wickham and Bryan 2020) package. From the RStudio IDE go to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; R Package then select “R package” and fill in the small form, namely name the package and specify the directory where it should be created. FIGURE 2.1: Package creation wizard But it could be argued that it’s actually easier from the R console with the usethis package. The create_package function takes as first argument the path to create the package. If you run it from RStudio a new project window should open. # creates a package named &quot;test&quot; in root of directory. usethis::create_package(&quot;test&quot;) ✔ Creating &#39;test/&#39; ✔ Setting active project to &#39;/Packages/test&#39; ✔ Creating &#39;R/&#39; ✔ Writing &#39;DESCRIPTION&#39; Package: test Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case) Version: 0.0.0.9000 Authors@R (parsed): * First Last &lt;first.last@example.com&gt; [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID) Description: What the package does (one paragraph). License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a license Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) RoxygenNote: 7.1.1.9000 ✔ Writing &#39;NAMESPACE&#39; ✔ Changing working directory to &#39;test/&#39; ✔ Setting active project to &#39;&lt;no active project&gt;&#39; 2.1.2 Metadata Every R package includes a DESCRIPTION file which includes metadata about the package. This includes a range of things like the license defining who can use the package, the name of the package, its dependencies, and more. Below is the default created by the usethis package with usethis::create_package(\"test\"). Package: test Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case) Version: 0.0.0.9000 Authors@R: person(given = &quot;First&quot;, family = &quot;Last&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;), email = &quot;first.last@example.com&quot;, comment = c(ORCID = &quot;YOUR-ORCID-ID&quot;)) Description: What the package does (one paragraph). License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a license Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE) RoxygenNote: 7.1.1.9000 Much of this is outside the scope of the book. However, it is good to grasp how dependencies are specified. As packages are generally intended for sharing with others it is important to ensure users of the package meet the dependencies otherwise the package may not work in places. For instance, were we to create a package that relies on one or more functions from the stringr (Wickham 2019) package we would need to ensure people who install the package actually have it installed on their machine or those functions will not work. # R/string.R string_length &lt;- function(string) { stringr::str_length(string) } Note that the function is preceded by its namespace with :: (more on this later). The DESCRIPTION file does this, it will make sure that the dependencies of the package are met by users who install it. We can specify such dependencies under Imports where we can list packages required separated by a comma. Imports: stringr, dplyr Then again, the usethis package also allows doing so consistently from the R console, which is great to avoid mishandling the DESCRIPTION file. # add stringr under Imports usethis::use_package(&#39;stringr&#39;) One can also specify another type of dependencies under Suggests, other packages that enhance that enhance the package but are not required to run it. These, unlike package under ‘Imports’ are not automatically installed if missing which can greatly reduce overhead. 2.1.3 R code An R package must follow a strict structure. R code must be placed in an R/ directory so one should only find .R files in that directory. These files generally contain functions, methods, and R objects. # R/add.R string_length &lt;- function(strings) { stringr::str_length(strings) } 2.1.4 Documentation Documenting packages used to be notoriously complicated but thanks to the package roxygen2 it is no longer the case. The documentation of functions of the package (accessible with ?) and datasets that comprise the package reside in separate files sitting in the man/ directory. These are .Rd files that use a custom syntax resembling LaTex. The roxygen package eases the creation of these files by turning special comments and tags in .R files into said .Rd files. Special comments are a standard R comment # followed by an apostrophe '. The first sentence of the documentation is the title of the documentation file while the second is the description. #&#39; Strings Length #&#39; #&#39; Returns the number of characters in strings. string_length &lt;- function(strings) { stringr::str_length(strings) } There are a plethora of roxygen2 tags to further document different sections, below we use two different tags to document the parameters and give an example. #&#39; Strings Length #&#39; #&#39; Returns the number of characters in strings. #&#39; #&#39; @param strings A vector of character strings. #&#39; #&#39; @example string_length(c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)) string_length &lt;- function(strings) { stringr::str_length(strings) } As well as generating documentation the roxygen2 package also allows populating the NAMESPACE file. This is an extensive and often confusing topic but for the purpose of this book we’ll content with the following: the NAMESPACE includes functions that are imported and exported by the package. By default functions that are present in the R files in the R/ directory are not exported: they are not accessible outside the package. Therefore the string_length function defined previously will not be made available to users of the package, only other function within the package will be able to call it. In order to export it we can use the @export tag. This will place the function as exported in the NAMESPACE file. #&#39; Strings Length #&#39; #&#39; Returns the number of characters in strings. #&#39; #&#39; @param strings A vector of character strings. #&#39; #&#39; @example string_length(c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)) #&#39; #&#39; @export string_length &lt;- function(strings) { stringr::str_length(strings) } There are two ways to use external functions (functions from other R packages), as done thus far in the string_length function by using the namespace (package name) to call the function: stringr::str_length. Or by importing the function needed using a roxygen2 tag thereby removing the need for using the namespace. #&#39; Strings Length #&#39; #&#39; Returns the number of characters in strings. #&#39; #&#39; @param strings A vector of character strings. #&#39; #&#39; @example string_length(c(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;)) #&#39; #&#39; @importFrom stringr str_length #&#39; #&#39; @export string_length &lt;- function(strings) { str_length(strings) # namespace removed } Above we import the function str_length from the stringr package using the importFrom roxygen2 tag. The first term following the tag is the name of the package wherefrom to import the functions and the following terms are the name of the functions separated by spaces so one can import multiple functions from the same package with, e.g.: @importFrom stringr str_length str_to_upper. If the package uses very many functions from a single package one might also consider importing said package in its entirety with e.g.: @import stringr. Finally, one can actually generate the .Rd documentation files and populate the NAMESPACE with either the devtools::document() function or roxygen2::roxygenise(). Remember to run devtools::document() after changing roxygen2 tags otherwise changes are not actually reflected in the NAMESPACE and documentation. 2.1.5 Installed files Here we tackle the topic of installed files as it will be relevant to much of what the book covers. Installed files are files that are downloaded and copied as-is when users install the package. This directory will therefore come in very handy to store JavaScript files that package will require. These files can be accessed with the system.file function which will look for a file from the root of the inst/ directory. # return path to `inst/dependency.js` in `myPackage` path &lt;- system.file(&quot;dependency.js&quot;, package = &quot;myPackage&quot;) 2.1.6 Build, load, and install Finally, after generating the documentation of the package with devtools::document() one can install it locally with devtools::install(). This however can take a few seconds too many whilst developing a package as one iterates and regularly tries things; devtools::load_all() will not install the package but load all the functions and object in the global environment to let you run them. There is some cyclical nature to developing packages: Write some code Run devtools::document() (if documentation tags have changed) Run devtools::load_all() Repeat Note whilst this short guide will help you develop packages good enough for your system it will certainly not pass CRAN checks. 2.2 JSON JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a very popular data interchange format with which we will work extensively throughout this book, it is thus crucial that we have a good understanding of it before we plunge into the nitty-gritty. As one might foresee, if we want two languages to work together it is essential that we have a data format that can be understood by both—JSON lets us harmoniously pass data from one to the other. While it is natively supported in JavaScript, it can be graciously handled in R with the jsonlite package (Ooms 2020), in fact it is the serialiser used internally by all the packages we shall explore in this book. “To serialise” is just jargon for converting data to JSON. 2.2.1 Serialising JSON is to all intents and purposes the equivalent of lists in R; a flexible data format that can store pretty much anything–expect data.frames a structure that does not exist in JavaScript. Below we create a nested list and convert it to JSON with the help of jsonlite, we set pretty to TRUE to add indentation for clearer printing but this is an argument you should omit when writing production code, it will reduce the file size (fewer spaces = smaller file size). # install.packages(&quot;jsonlite&quot;) library(jsonlite) lst &lt;- list( a = 1, b = list( c = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ), d = 1:5 ) toJSON(lst, pretty = TRUE) #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;a&quot;: [1], #&gt; &quot;b&quot;: { #&gt; &quot;c&quot;: [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] #&gt; }, #&gt; &quot;d&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #&gt; } Looking closely at the list and JSON output above one quickly sees the resemblance. Something seems odd though, the first value in the list (a = 1) was serialised to an array (vector) of length one (\"a\": [1]) where one would probably expect an integer instead, 1 not [1]. This is not a mistake, we often forget that there are no scalar types in R and that a is in fact a vector as we can observe below. x &lt;- 1 length(x) #&gt; [1] 1 is.vector(x) #&gt; [1] TRUE JavaScript, on the other hand, does have scalar types, more often than not we will want to convert the vectors of length one to scalar types rather than arrays of length one. To do so we need use the auto_unbox argument in jsonlite::toJSON, we’ll do this most of the time we have to convert data to JSON. toJSON(lst, pretty = TRUE, auto_unbox = TRUE) #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;a&quot;: 1, #&gt; &quot;b&quot;: { #&gt; &quot;c&quot;: [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] #&gt; }, #&gt; &quot;d&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #&gt; } As demonstrated above the vector of length one was “unboxed” into an integer, with auto_unbox set to TRUE jsonlite will properly convert such vectors into their appropriate type; integer, numeric, boolean, etc. Note that this only applies to vectors, lists of length one will be serialised to arrays of length one even with auto_unbox turned on: list(\"hello\") will always be converted to [\"hello\"]. 2.2.2 Tabular Data If JSON is more or less the equivalent of lists in R one might wonder how jsonlite handles dataframes since they do not exist in JavaScript. # subset of built-in dataset df &lt;- cars[1:2, ] toJSON(df, pretty = TRUE) #&gt; [ #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 4, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 2 #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 4, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 10 #&gt; } #&gt; ] What jsonlite does internally is essentially turn the data.frame into a list rowwise to produce a sub-list for every row then it serialises to JSON. This is generally how rectangular data is represented in lists, for instance, purrr::transpose does the same. Another great example is to use console.table in the JavaScript console (more on that later) to display the table JSON as a table. FIGURE 2.2: console.table output We can reproduce this with the snippet below, we remove row names and use apply to turn every row into a list. row.names(df) &lt;- NULL df_list &lt;- apply(df, 1, as.list) toJSON(df_list, pretty = TRUE, auto_unbox = TRUE) #&gt; [ #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 4, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 2 #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 4, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 10 #&gt; } #&gt; ] Jsonlite of course also enables reading data from JSON into R with the function fromJSON. json &lt;- toJSON(df) # convert to JSON fromJSON(json) # read from JSON #&gt; speed dist #&gt; 1 4 2 #&gt; 2 4 10 It’s important to note that jsonlite did the conversion back to a data frame. Therefore the code below also returns a data frame even though the object we initially converted to JSON is a list. class(df_list) #&gt; [1] &quot;list&quot; json &lt;- toJSON(df_list) fromJSON(json) #&gt; speed dist #&gt; 1 4 2 #&gt; 2 4 10 Jsonlite provides many more options and functions that will let you tune how JSON data is read and written. Also, the jsonlite package does far more than what we detailed in this section but at this juncture this is an adequate understanding of things. 2.3 JavaScript The book is not meant to teach one JavaScript, only to show how graciously it can work with R. Let us thus go through the very basics to ensure we know enough to get started with the coming chapters. The easiest way to run JavaScript interactively is probably to create an HTML file (e.g.: try.html), write your code within a &lt;script&gt; tags and open the file in your web browser. The console output can be observed in the console of the browser, developer tools (more on that below). &lt;!–– index.html ––&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Trying JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; // place your JavaScript code here console.log(&#39;Hello JavaScript!&#39;) &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; FIGURE 2.3: Trying JavaScript 2.3.1 Developer Tools Most of the JavaScript code written in this book is intended to be run in web browsers, it is thus vital that you have a great understanding of your web browser and its developer tools (devtools). In this section we discuss those available in Google Chrome and Chromium but such tools, albeit somewhat different, also exist in Mozilla Firefox and Safari. The RStudio IDE is built on Chromium, some of these tools will therefore also work in RStudio. The easiest way to access the developer the developer tools from the browser is by “inspecting:” right click on an element on a webpage and select “inspect”. This will open the developer tools either at the bottom or on the right of the page. FIGURE 2.4: Google Chrome Devtools The developer tools pane consists of several tabs but we will mainly use: Elements: Presents the DOM Tree, the HTML document structure, great for inspecting the structure of the outputs generated from R. Console: The JavaScript console where messages, errors, and other such things are logged. Essential for debugging. 2.3.2 Variable Declaration and Scope One major way JavaScript differs from R is that variables must be declared using one of three keywords, var, let, or const which mainly affect the scope where the declared variable will be accessible from. x = 1; // error var x = 1; // works One can declare a variable without assigning a value to it, to then do so later on. var y; // declare y = [1,2,3]; // define it as array y = &#39;string&#39;; // change to character string The let and const keywords were added in ES2015, the const is used to defined a constant: a variable that once declared cannot be changed. const x = 1; // declare constant x = 2; // error Though this is probably only rarely done in R, one can produce something similar by locking the binding for a variable in its environment. x &lt;- 1 # declare x lockBinding(&quot;x&quot;, env = .GlobalEnv) # make constant x &lt;- 2 # error #&gt; Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): cannot change value of locked binding for &#39;x&#39; unlockBinding(&quot;x&quot;, env = .GlobalEnv) # unlock binding x &lt;- 2 # works The let keyword is akin to declaring a variable with the var keyword, however let (and const) will declare the variable in the “block scope.” This in effect further narrows down the scope where the variable will be accessible, a block scope is generally the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops: areas within curly brackets. if(true){ let x = 1; var y = 1; } console.log(x) // error x does not exist console.log(y) // works In the above example x is only accessible within the if statement as it is declared with let, var does not have a block scope. While on the subject of scope, in R like in JavaScript, variables can be accessed from the parent environment (often referred to as “context” in the latter). One immense difference though is that while it is seen as bad practice in R it is not in JavaScript where it is extremely useful. # it works but don&#39;t do this in R x &lt;- 123 foo &lt;- function(){ print(x) } foo() #&gt; [1] 123 The above R code can be re-written in JavaScript. Note the slight variation in the function declaration. // this is perfectly fine var x = 1; function foo(){ console.log(x); // print to console } foo(); Accessing variables from the parent environment (context) is useful in JavaScript but should not be done in R 2.3.3 Document Object Model One concept which does not exist in R is that of the “DOM” which stands for Document Object Model, this is also often referred to as the DOM tree as it very much follows a tree-like structure. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the web page which can be accessed in JavaScript from the document object. This lets the developer programmatically manipulate the page itself so one can for instance, add an element (e.g.: a button), change the text of another, and plenty more. The JavaScript code below grabs the element where id='content' from the document with getElementById and replaces the text (innerText). Even though the page only contains “Trying JavaScript!” when the page is opened (loaded) in the web browser JavaScript runs the code and changes it: this happens very fast so the original text cannot be seen. &lt;!–– index.html ––&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Trying JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; var cnt = document.getElementById(&quot;content&quot;); cnt.innerText = &quot;The text has changed&quot;; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; One final thing to note for future reference, though not limited to the ids or classes most such selection of elements from the DOM are done with those where the pound sign refers to an element’s id (#id) and a dot refers to an element’s class (.class), just like in CSS. &lt;!–– index.html ––&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;content&quot; class=&quot;stuff&quot;&gt;Trying JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; // select by id var x = document.getElementById(&quot;content&quot;); var y = document.querySelector(&quot;#content&quot;); console.log(x == y); // true // select by class var z = document.querySelector(&quot;.stuff&quot;); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Getting elements from the DOM is a very common operation in JavaScript. While a class can be applied to multiple elements which is useful to get and apply actions to multiple elements, the id attribute must be unique (no two elements can bear the same id in the HTML document) is useful to retrieve a specific element. Interestingly some of that mechanism is used by shiny to retrieve and manipulate inputs, the argument inputId of shiny inputs effectively define the HTML id attribute of said input. Shiny can then internally make use of functions the likes of getElementById in order to get those inputs, set or update their values, etc. shiny::actionButton(inputId = &quot;theId&quot;, label = &quot;the label&quot;) &lt;button id=&quot;theId&quot; type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-default action-button&quot;&gt; the label &lt;/button&gt; This of course only scratches the surface of JavaScript thus this provides ample understanding of the language to keep up with the next chapters. Also, a somewhat interesting fact that will prove useful later in the book: the RStudio IDE is actually a browser, therefore, in the IDE, one can right-click and “inspect element” to view the rendered source code. 2.4 Shiny It is assumed that the reader has basic knowledge of the shiny framework and already used it to build applications. However, there are some more obscure functionalities that one may not know but that become essential when introducing JavaScript to applications. Chiefly, how to import external dependencies; JavaScript or otherwise. There are two ways to import dependencies: using the htmltools (Cheng et al. 2020) package to create a dependency object that shiny can understand or manually serving and importing the files with shiny. 2.4.1 Serving Static Files Static files are files that are downloaded by the clients, in this case web browsers accessing shiny applications, as-is, these generally include images, CSS (.css), and JavaScript (.js). If you are familiar with R packages, static files are to shiny applications what the inst directory is to an R package, those files are installed as-is and do not require further processing as opposed to the src folder which contains files that need compiling for instance. There are numerous functions to launch a shiny application locally; the two most used probably are shinyApp and runApp. The RStudio IDE comes with a convenient “Run” button when writing a shiny application, which when clicked actually uses the function shiny::runApp in the background, this function looks for said static files in the www directory and makes them available at the same path (/www). If you are building your applications outside of RStudio, you should either also use shiny::runApp or specify the directory which then allows using shiny::shinyApp. Note that this only applies locally, shiny server (community and pro) as well as shinyapps.io use the same defaults as the RStudio IDE and shiny::runApp. In order to ensure the code in this book can run regardless of the reader’s machine or editor, the asset directory (when used) is always specified explicitly. This is probably advised to steer clear of the potential headaches as, unlike the default, it’ll work regardless of the environment. If you are using golem (Fay et al. 2020) to develop your application then you should not worry about this as it specifies the directory internally. Below we build a basic shiny application, however, before we define the ui and server we use the shiny::addResourcePath function to specify the location of the directory of static files that will be served by the server and thus accessible by the client. This function takes two arguments, first the prefix, which is the path (URL) at which the assets will be available, second the path to the directory of static assets. We thus create the “assets” directory and a JavaScript file called script.js within it. # run from root of app (where app.R is located) dir.create(&quot;assets&quot;) writeLines(&quot;console.log(&#39;Hello JS!&#39;);&quot;, con = &quot;assets/script.js&quot;) We can now use the shiny::addResourcePath to point to this directory. Generally the same name for the directory of static assets and prefix is used so as to avoid confusion, below we name them differently in order for the reader to clearly distinguish which is which. # app.R library(shiny) # serve the files addResourcePath( # will be accessible at /files prefix = &quot;files&quot;, # path to the assets directory directoryPath = &quot;assets&quot; ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( h1(&quot;R and JavaScript&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui, server) If you then run the application and open it at the /files/script.js path (e.g.: 127.0.0.1:3000/files/script.js) you should see the content of the JavaScript file (console.log('Hello JS!')), commenting the addResourcePath line will have a “Not Found” error displayed on the page instead. All files in your asset directory will be served online and accessible to anyone: do not place sensitive files in it. Though one may create multiple such directory and correspondingly use addResourcePath to specify multiple paths and prefixes, one will routinely specify a single one, named “assets” or “static,” which contains multiple subdirectories, one for each type of static file to obtain a directory that looks something like the tree below. This is, however, an unwritten convention which is by no means forced upon the developer: do as you wish. assets/ ├── js/ │ └── script.js ├── css/ │ └── style.css └── img/ └── pic.png At this stage we have made the JavaScript file we created accessible by the clients but we still have to source this file in the ui as currently this file is, though served, not used by the application. Were one creating a static HTML page one would use the script to src the file in the head of the page. &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!–– source the JavaScript file ––&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;path/to/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Trying JavaScript!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; In shiny we write the ui in R and not in HTML (though this is also supported). Given the resemblance between the names of HTML tags and shiny UI functions it’s pretty straightforward, the html page above would look something like the shiny ui below. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( singleton( tags$head( tags$script(src = &quot;path/to/script.js&quot;) ) ), p(id = &quot;content&quot;, &quot;Trying JavaScript!&quot;) ) The dependency is used in the singleton function (from htmltools) ensure that its content is only imported in the document once. Note that we use the tags object which comes from the shiny package and includes HTML tags that are not exported as standalone functions. For instance, you can create a &lt;div&gt; in shiny with the div function but tags$div will also work. This can now be applied to the shiny application, the path/to/script.js should be changed to files/script.js where files is the prefix we defined in addResourcePath. # app.R library(shiny) # serve the files addResourcePath(prefix = &quot;files&quot;, directoryPath = &quot;assets&quot;) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script(src = &quot;files/script.js&quot;) ), h1(&quot;R and JavaScript&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){} shinyApp(ui, server) From the browser, inspecting page (right click &gt; inspect &gt; console tab) one should see Hello JS! in the console which means the application correctly ran the code in the JavaScript file. 2.4.2 Htmltools The htmltools package powers much of the shiny UI, most of the tags that comprise the UI are indeed imported by shiny from htmltools. For instance shiny::actionButton is just a light wrapper around htmltools tags. shiny::actionButton function (inputId, label, icon = NULL, width = NULL, ...) { value &lt;- restoreInput(id = inputId, default = NULL) tags$button( id = inputId, style = if (!is.null(width)) paste0(&quot;width: &quot;, validateCssUnit(width), &quot;;&quot;), type = &quot;button&quot;, class = &quot;btn btn-default action-button&quot;, `data-val` = value, list(validateIcon(icon), label), ... ) } As the name indicates htmltools goes beyond the generation of HTML tags and provides broader tools to work with HTML from R, this includes working the dependencies. These may appear simple at first, after all were one working with an HTML document in order to import HTML or CSS one could simply use HTML tags. &lt;!–– index.html ––&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;path/to/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;path/to/styles.css&quot;&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; However, it can quickly get out of hand when working with modules and packages. Imagine having to manage the generation of dependencies such as the above when multiple functions rely on a dependency but being a dependency it should only be imported once? The unified framework htmltools helps immensely in dealing with these sorts of issues. The htmltools package provides utilities to import dependencies and ensure these are only rendered once, as they should be. The way this works is by creating a dependency object that packages like Shiny and R markdown can understand and translate into HTML dependencies. This is handled with the htmlDependency function which returns an object of class html_dependency. dependency &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;myDependency&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = c(file = &quot;path/to/directory&quot;), script = &quot;script.js&quot;, stylesheet = &quot;styles.css&quot; ) About the above, the src argument points to the directory that contains the dependencies (script and stylesheet), this is done with a named vector where file indicates the path is a local directory and href indicates it is a remote serve, generally a CDN. Note that one can also pass multiple script and stylesheet by using vectors, e.g.: c(\"script.js\", \"anotherScript.js\") CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, a geographically distributed group of servers that provide fast transfer of dependencies. # dependency to the latest jQuery dependency &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;myDependency&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = c( href = &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery/dist/&quot; ), script = &quot;jquery.min.js&quot; ) Shiny, R markdown, and other packages where htmltools is relevant will then be able to translate an html_dependency object into actual HTML dependencies. The above would for instance generate the following HTML. &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Importantly, the htmltools::htmlDependency also takes a package argument which makes it such that the src path becomes relative to the package directory (the inst folder). Hence the snippet below imports a file located at myPackage/inst/assets/script.js; the ultimate full path will of course depend on where the package is installed on the users’ machine. dependency &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;myDependency&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = &quot;assets&quot;, script = c(file = &quot;script.js&quot;), package = &quot;myPackage&quot; # user package ) But does one use it in R markdown or shiny? Well simply placing it in the Shiny UI or an evaluated R markdown chunk will the the job. # place it in the shiny UI ui &lt;- fluidPage( htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;myDependency&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = &quot;assets&quot;, script = c(file = &quot;script.js&quot;), package = &quot;myPackage&quot; # user package ) ) 2.4.3 Serving vs. htmltools For multiple reasons, the best way to include dependencies is probably the former using htmltools. First, it will work with both shiny and rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2020) (whereas the other method shown only works with shiny) reducing the cognitive load on the developer (you); learn to use this method and you will be bale to import dependencies for many different output types. Moreover it comes with neat features that will be explored later in the book, e.g.: dynamic dependencies for interactive visualisations or shiny. Also, using htmltools dependencies will allow other package developers to easily assess and access the dependencies you build. The function findDependencies will accept another function from which it can extract the dependencies. The object it returns can then be used elsewhere making dependencies portable. Below we use this function to extract the dependencies of the fluidPage function from the shiny package. htmltools::findDependencies( shiny::fluidPage() ) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; List of 10 #&gt; $ name : chr &quot;bootstrap&quot; #&gt; $ version : chr &quot;3.4.1&quot; #&gt; $ src :List of 2 #&gt; ..$ href: chr &quot;shared/bootstrap&quot; #&gt; ..$ file: chr &quot;/home/jp/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/shiny/www/shared/bootstrap&quot; #&gt; $ meta :List of 1 #&gt; ..$ viewport: chr &quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot; #&gt; $ script : chr [1:3] &quot;js/bootstrap.min.js&quot; &quot;shim/html5shiv.min.js&quot; &quot;shim/respond.min.js&quot; #&gt; $ stylesheet: chr &quot;css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; #&gt; $ head : NULL #&gt; $ attachment: NULL #&gt; $ package : NULL #&gt; $ all_files : logi TRUE #&gt; - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;html_dependency&quot; Extracting dependencies from other packages will become useful later in the book as we try to assess and whether package we build can work together with other packages: making sure dependencies do not clash or importing dependencies from other packages. Using shiny::addResourcePath has one advantage, its use is not limited to making CSS and JavaScript files available in Shiny, it can be used to serve other file types such as JSON or images that may also be needed in the application. References "],["widgets-intro-intro.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to Widgets 3.1 Plotly package 3.2 DT package", " Chapter 3 Introduction to Widgets This part of the book explores the integration of JavaScript with R using the htmlwidgets package which focuses on libraries that produce a visual output, it is often used for data visualisation but is not limited to it. As in future parts of this book we mainly learn through examples, building multiple widgets of increasing complexity as we progress through the chapters. Before writing the first widget, we explore existing R packages that allow creating interactive data visualisations as this gives a first glimpse at we build in this part of the book. Then we explore JavaScript libraries that make great candidates for htmlwidgets and attempt to understand how they work to grasp what is expected from the developer in order to integrate them with R. Finally, we build up on the previous chapter to improve how htmlwidgets work with shiny. The htmlwidgets package originates from the rCharts (Vaidyanathan 2013) package created in 2012 by Ramnath Vaidyanathan. It brough together a plethora of data visualisation JavaScript libraries, datamaps, highcharts, morris.js, and many more. Though no longer maintained rCharts ultimately paved the way towards a framework for interactive visualisations in R: two years later, in 2014 Ramnath and other prominent R users start working on htmlwidgets. The objective of this chapter is to explore existing widgets available on CRAN, discover how they work, whilst focusing on their prominent features as we will learn how to implement those in our very own widget in the coming chapters. 3.1 Plotly package The plotly (Sievert et al. 2020) R package is probably one of the first and the most popular widget built thus far, it has been downloaded from CRAN 4.9 million times at the time of writing this. Plotly.js is a substantial library that provides over 40 chart types, including 3D charts, statistical graphs, and maps, all of which are available from the R interface, there is in fact so much depth to plotly that there is an entire book on the topic. library(plotly) #&gt; Loading required package: ggplot2 #&gt; #&gt; Attaching package: &#39;plotly&#39; #&gt; The following object is masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; last_plot #&gt; The following object is masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; filter #&gt; The following object is masked from &#39;package:graphics&#39;: #&gt; #&gt; layout plot_ly(cars, x = ~speed, y = ~dist) %&gt;% add_markers() Plotly also has the ability to translate static ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2020) charts to interactive plotly charts with the ggplotly function. p &lt;- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = log(carat), y = log(price))) + geom_hex(bins = 100) ggplotly(p) All plotly charts are initialised with the plot_ly function and work nicely with the magrittr (Bache and Wickham 2014) pipe %&gt;%. This implies that (almost) every function expects a plotly object (the output of plot_ly) and returns a modified version of that object. The pipe makes code easier to read and more concise. p &lt;- plot_ly(cars, x = ~speed, y = ~dist) p &lt;- add_markers(p) Plotly implements geoms in a similar fashion as ggplot2, functions that start in add_ add a layer to the plot (e.g.: add_lines, add_bars). plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~disp) %&gt;% add_markers(y = ~mpg, text = rownames(mtcars)) %&gt;% add_lines(y = ~fitted(loess(mpg ~ disp))) 3.2 DT package The DT package (Xie, Cheng, and Tan 2020) is a wrapper for the DataTables jQuery plug-in which allows creating interactive tables from R data.frame objects. DT::datatable(cars) DT has grown very popular amongst shiny developers as it allows capturing server-side many of the users’ interactions with the table such as the selected row. library(DT) library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( fluidRow( column(8, DTOutput(&quot;myTable&quot;)), column( 4, h4(&quot;Indices of selected rows&quot;), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;selected&quot;) ) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$myTable &lt;- renderDT({ datatable(mtcars) }) output$selected &lt;- renderPrint({ input$myTable_rows_selected }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 3.1: DT package example References "],["widgets-basics.html", "Chapter 4 Basics of Building Widgets 4.1 Read &amp; Study 4.2 Candidate Libraries 4.3 How it works", " Chapter 4 Basics of Building Widgets Having explored existing packages that build on top of the htmlwidgets package gives some idea of the end product but much of how it works and where to start probably remains somewhat mysterious. 4.1 Read &amp; Study Once you have found an interesting library that you would like to use from R, the very first step when building a widget is to thoroughly study the JavaScript library one wants to integrate. Often one will overlook this step only to pay it back dearly later on. Start where the documentation tells you to start, often a “hello world” example, or a get-started section. This will already give you a good sense of how this library functions, the expected data format, and more. Second it’s good to head to the “installation” part of the documentation to know more about the library’s dependencies, see whether it is modularised or available in a single bundle, etc. Look at examples in more depth, you’ve likely already taken a look at some but observe the source code of those in more details. One cue to know if the library will be more or less complex to integrate with R is whether the various snippets of code that generate the examples are similar or drastically different: commonalities make for easier abstractions and ultimately simpler R code and packages. Some libraries will ultimately be easier to integrate than others. At this stage you should have some idea of what it will take to bring the library to R, and though you likely have some idea of what are the functions and methods that comprise the library from the examples you should look at the “API,” or proper “documentation” of the API to grasp exactly what is available. Finally, before starting the R work, it is advised to properly experience using the library as it was intended: with JavaScript and HTML. This will further give a sense of which part of the API are great and which not so much. This is useful to know because you will get to improve or mirror this API in R when you develop the widget for it. This is likely a section you will want to come back to at the end of this part as you browse for libraries to integrate in your workflow. 4.2 Candidate Libraries Before going down the rabbit hole it is good to take a look at the types of libraries one will work with. As htmlwidgets’ main clients are JavaScript visualisation libraries let us take a look at some such popular libraries and briefly analyse at how they work and what they have in common. This will greatly help conceptualise what one is trying to achieve in this chapter. 4.2.1 Plotly.js Plotly.js is probably one of the more popular out there, it provides over 40 fully customiseable chart types, many of which are very sophisticated. This is indeed the JavaScript library used by the R package of the same name: plotly. Looking at the code presented in the “Get Started” guide reveals just how convenient the library is. One must import plotly, of course, then have a &lt;div&gt; where the visualisation will be placed, then, using Plotly.newPlot, create the actual visualisation by passing it first the element previously mentioned and a JSON of options that describe the chart. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Import library --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;plotly-latest.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- div to hold visualisation --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;chart&quot; style=&quot;width:600px;height:400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Script to create visualisation --&gt; &lt;script&gt; el = document.getElementById(&#39;chart&#39;); Plotly.newPlot(el, [{ x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] }] ); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; FIGURE 4.1: Plotly example Now let’s look at how another popular library does it. 4.2.2 Highchart.js Highcharts is another library which allows creating gorgeous visualisation, maps, and more, it’s also very popular albeit not being entirely open-source. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Import library --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;highcharts.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- div to hold visualisation --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;chart&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;height:400px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Script to create visualisation --&gt; &lt;script&gt; var myChart = Highcharts.chart(&#39;chart&#39;, { xAxis: { categories: [&#39;Apples&#39;, &#39;Bananas&#39;, &#39;Oranges&#39;] }, series: [{ name: &#39;Jane&#39;, data: [1, 0, 4] }, { name: &#39;John&#39;, data: [5, 7, 3] }] }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; FIGURE 4.2: Highcharts example The above is very similar to what plotly.js requires: import libraries, create a &lt;div&gt; where to put the visualisation, and, to create the chart, run a function which also takes the id of the div where to place the chart and a JSON of options defining the actual chart, including the data. 4.2.3 Chart.js Chart.js is yet another library which to draw standard charts popular for its permissive license and convenient API. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Import library --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;Chart.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- canvas to hold visualisation --&gt; &lt;canvas id=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt; &lt;!-- Script to create visualisation --&gt; &lt;script&gt; var el = document.getElementById(&#39;chart&#39;).getContext(&#39;2d&#39;); var myChart = new Chart(el, { type: &#39;bar&#39;, data: { labels: [&#39;Red&#39;, &#39;Blue&#39;, &#39;Yellow&#39;, &#39;Green&#39;, &#39;Purple&#39;, &#39;Orange&#39;], datasets: [{ label: &#39;# of Votes&#39;, data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3] }] } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; FIGURE 4.3: Chart.js example We again observe a very similar structure as with previous libraries. The library is imported, instead of a div chart.js uses a canvas, and the visualisation is also created from a single function which takes the canvas as first argument and a JSON of options as second. Hopefully this reveals the repeating structure such libraries tend to follow as well as demonstrate how little JavaScript code is actually involved. It also hints at what should be reproduced, to some extent at least, using R. 4.3 How it works Imagine there is no such package as htmlwidgets to help create interactive visualisations from R: how would one attempt to go about it? As observed, an interactive visualisation using JavaScript will be contained within an HTML document, therefore it would probably have to be created first. Secondly, the visualisation that is yet to be created likely relies on external libraries, these would need to be imported in the document. The document should also include an HTML element (e.g.: &lt;div&gt;) to host said visualisation. Then data would have to be serialised in R and embedded into the document where it should be read by JavaScript code that uses it to create the visualisation. Finally all should be managed to work seamlessly across R markdown, shiny, and other environments. This gives the following basic diagram, it will be broken down further in the next chapter as the first widget is build. Thankfully the htmlwidgets package is there to handle most of this. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that these operations are undertaken (to some degree) by htmlwidgets. "],["widgets-first.html", "Chapter 5 Your First Widget 5.1 The Scaffold 5.2 The HTML Output 5.3 JavaScript Files", " Chapter 5 Your First Widget The previous chapter gave some indication as to how widgets work but this is overall probably still shrouded in mystery. This chapter aims at demystifying what remains confusing. This is done by building a very basic widget with the aim of rummaging through its components to observe how they interact and ultimately grasp a greater understanding of how such interactive outputs are actually produced. 5.1 The Scaffold Though one could probably create widgets outside of an R package, it would only make things more complicated, htmlwidgets naturally take the form of R packages and are stunningly simple to create. Below we create a package named “playground” which will be used to mess around and explore. usethis::create_package(&quot;playground&quot;) Then, from the root of the package created, we scaffold a widget which we call “play”. htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget(&quot;play&quot;) This function puts together the minimalistic structure necessary to implement an HTML widget and opens play.R, play.js and play.yaml in the RStudio IDE or the default text editor. You can scaffold multiple widgets in a single package. These files are named after the widget and will form the core of the package. The R file contains core functions of the R API, namely the play function which creates the widget itself, and the render* and *output functions that handle the widget in the shiny server and UI respectively. The .js file contains JavaScript functions that actually generate the visual output. devtools::document() devtools::load_all() It might be hard to believe, but at this stage one already has a fully functioning widget ready to use after documenting, and building the package. Indeed, the play.R file that was created contains a function named “play” which takes, amongst other arguments, a message. play(message = &quot;This is a widget!&quot;) FIGURE 5.1: First widget This displays the message in the RStudio “Viewer,” or the your default browser which indicates that the function does indeed create an HTML output. One can use the button located in the top right of the RStudio “Viewer” to open the message in web browser which can prove very useful to look under the hood of the widgets for debugging. 5.2 The HTML Output With an out-of-the-box HTML widget package one can start exploring the internals to understand how it works. Let’s start by retracing the path taken by the message written in R to its seemingly magical appearance in HTML. The play function previously used, takes the message wraps it into a list which is then used in htmlwidgets::createWidget. # forward options using x x = list( message = message ) Wrapping a string in a list might seem unnecessary but one will eventually add variables when building a more complex widget, starting with a list makes it easier to add them later on. To investigate the widget we should look under the hood; the source code of the created (and rendered) output can be accessed in different ways, 1) by right-clicking on the message displayed in the RStudio Viewer and selecting “Inspect element,” or 2) by opening the visualisation in your browser using the button located in the top right of the “Viewer,” and in the browser right clicking on the message to select “Inspect.” The latter is advised as web browsers such as Chrome or Firefox provide much friendlier interfaces for such functionalities as well as shortcuts to inspect or view the source code of a page. Below is a part of the &lt;body&gt; of the output of play(\"This is a widget!\") obtained with the method described in the previous paragraph. &lt;div id=&quot;htmlwidget_container&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;htmlwidget-c21cca0e76e520b46fc7&quot; style=&quot;width:960px;height:500px;&quot; class=&quot;play html-widget&quot;&gt; This is a widget! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;application/json&quot; data-for=&quot;htmlwidget-c21cca0e76e520b46fc7&quot;&gt; {&quot;x&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;This is a widget!&quot;},&quot;evals&quot;:[],&quot;jsHooks&quot;:[]} &lt;/script&gt; One thing the source code of the rendered output reveals is the element (&lt;div&gt;) created by the htmlwidgets package to hold the message (the class name is identical to that of the widget, play), as well as, below it, in the &lt;script&gt; tag, the JSON object which includes the x variable used in the play function. The div created bears a randomly generated id which one can define when creating the widget using the elementId argument. # specify the id play(&quot;This is another widget&quot;, elementId = &quot;myViz&quot;) &lt;!-- div bears id specified in R --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;myViz&quot; style=&quot;width:960px;height:500px;&quot; class=&quot;play html-widget&quot;&gt; This is another widget &lt;/div&gt; You will also notice that this affects the script tag below it, the data-for attribute of which is also set to “myViz,” this indicates that it is used to tie the JSON data to a div, essential for htmlwidgets to manage multiple visualisation in R markdown or Shiny for instance. Then again, this happens in the background without the developer (you) having to worry about it. &lt;script type=&quot;application/json&quot; data-for=&quot;myViz&quot;&gt; {&quot;x&quot;:{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;This is a widget!&quot;},&quot;evals&quot;:[],&quot;jsHooks&quot;:[]} &lt;/script&gt; Inspecting the output also shows the dependencies imported, these are placed within the head HTML tags at the top of the page. &lt;script src=&quot;lib/htmlwidgets-1.5.1/htmlwidgets.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;lib/play-binding-0.0.0.9000/play.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; This effectively imports the htmlwidgets.js library as well as the play.js file, and were the visualisation depending on external libraries they would appear alongside those. 5.3 JavaScript Files Peaking inside the play.js file located at inst/htmlwidgets/play.js reveals the code below: // play.js HTMLWidgets.widget({ name: &#39;play&#39;, type: &#39;output&#39;, factory: function(el, width, height) { // TODO: define shared variables for this instance return { renderValue: function(x) { // TODO: code to render the widget, e.g. el.innerText = x.message; }, resize: function(width, height) { // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size } }; } }); However convoluted this may appear at first do not let that intimate you. The name of the widget (play) corresponds to the name used to generate the scaffold, it can also be seen in the createWidget function used inside the play.R file. htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;play&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;playground&#39;, elementId = elementId ) This is so htmlwidgets can internally match the output of createWidget to its JavaScript function. At this stage it is probably good to take a look at the diagram of what is happening. The factory function returns two functions, resize, and renderValue. The first is used to dynamically resize the output, it is not relevant to this widget is thus tackled later on. Let us focus on renderValue, the function that actually renders the output. It takes an object x from which the “message” variable is used as text for object el (el.innerText). The object x passed to this function is actually the list of the same name that was build in the R function play! While in R one would access the message in list x with x$message in JavaScript to access the message in the JSON x one writes x.message, only changing the dollar sign to a dot. Let’s show this perhaps more clearly by printing the content of x. console.log(x); el.innerText = x.message; We place console.log to print the content of x in the console, reload the package with devtools::load_all and use the function play again then explore the console from the browser (inspect and go to the “console” tab). FIGURE 5.2: Console log JavaScript object This displays the JSON object containing the message: it looks eerily similar to the list that was created in R (x = list(message = \"This is a widget!\")). What one should take away from this is that data that needs to be communicated from R to the JavaScript function should be placed in the R list x. This list is serialised to JSON and placed in the HTML output in a script tag with a data-for attribute that indicates which widget the data is destined for. This effectively enables htmlwidgets to match the serialised data with the output elements: data in &lt;script data-for='viz'&gt; is to be used to create a visualisation in &lt;div id='viz'&gt;. Serialisation will make for an important section in a later chapter. Before we move on to other things one should also grasp a better understanding of the el object, which can also be logged in the console. console.log(x); console.log(el); el.innerText = x.message; FIGURE 5.3: Console log HTML element This displays the HTML element created by htmlwidgets that is meant to hold the visualisation, or in this case, the message. If you are familiar with JavaScript, this is the element that would be returned by document.getElementById. This object allows manipulating the element in pretty much any way imaginable, change its position, its colour, its size, or, as done here, to insert some text within it. What’s more one can access attributes of the object just like a JSON array. Therefore one can log the id of the element. // print the id of the element console.log(el.id); el.innerText = x.message; Making the modifications above and reloading the package, one can create a widget given a specific id and see it displayed in the console, e.g.: play(\"hello\", elementId = \"see-you-in-the-console\"). In an attempt to become more at ease with this setup let us change something and play with the widget. Out-of-the-box htmlwidgets uses innerText, which does very much what it says on the tin, it places text inside an element. JavaScript comes with another function akin to innerText, innerHTML. While the former only allows inserting text the latter lets one insert any HTML. el.innerHTML = x.message; After changing the play.js file as above, and re-loading the package, one can use arbitrary HTML as messages. play(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Using HTML!&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;) FIGURE 5.4: First widget output That makes for a great improvement which opens the door to many possibilities. However, the interface this provides is unintuitive. Albeit similar, R users are more familiar with shiny and htmltools (Cheng et al. 2020) tags than HTML tags, e.g.: &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; translates to h1() in R. The package should allow users to use those instead of forcing them to collapse HTML content in a string. Fortunately, there is a very easy way to obtain the HTML from those functions: convert it to a character string. html &lt;- shiny::h1(&quot;HTML tag&quot;) class(html) #&gt; [1] &quot;shiny.tag&quot; # returns string as.character(html) #&gt; [1] &quot;&lt;h1&gt;HTML tag&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; Implementing this in the play function will look like this. # forward options using x x = list( message = as.character(message) ) Reloading the package with devtools::load_all lets one use shiny tags as the message. play(shiny::h2(&quot;Chocolate is a colour&quot;, style = &quot;color:chocolate;&quot;)) FIGURE 5.5: First widget using shiny tags This hopefully provides some understanding of how htmlwidgets work internally and thereby helps building such packages. To recapitulate, an HTML document is created in which div is placed and given a certain id, this id is also used in a script tag that contains JSON data passed from R so that a JavaScript function we define can read that data in and use it to generate a visual output in a div. However, as much as this section covered, the topic of JavaScript dependencies was not touched, this is approached in the following section where we build another, more interesting widget, which uses an external dependency. References "],["widgets-realistic.html", "Chapter 6 A Realistic Widget 6.1 Dependencies 6.2 Implementation 6.3 HTML Element", " Chapter 6 A Realistic Widget In this section we build a package called peity which wraps the JavaScript library of the same name, peity.js to create inline charts. This builds upon many things we explored in the playground package built in the previous chapter. usethis::create_package(&quot;peity&quot;) htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget(&quot;peity&quot;) As done with candidate libraries, as explained in an earlier chapter there is no avoiding going through the documentation of the library one wants to use to observe how it works. Forging a basic understanding of the library we can build the following basic example. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Import libraries --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jquery-3.5.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jquery.peity.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- div to hold visualisation --&gt; &lt;span id=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;5,3,9,6,5,9,7,3,5,2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- Script to create visualisation --&gt; &lt;script&gt; $(&quot;#bar&quot;).peity(&quot;bar&quot;); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Peity.js depends on jQuery, hence the latter is imported first, the data for the chart is placed in a &lt;span&gt;, and the peity method is then used on the element containing the data. Peity.js uses &lt;span&gt; HTML tags as these work inline, using a &lt;div&gt; the chart will still display but the purpose of using peity.js would be defeated. 6.1 Dependencies Once the package created and the widget scaffold laid down we need to add the JavaScript dependencies without which nothing can move forward. Two dependencies are required in order for peity.js to run: peity.js and jQuery, instead of using the CDN those are downloaded as this ultimately makes the package more robust (more easily reproducible outputs and no requirement for internet connection). Each of the two library is placed in its own respective directory. dir.create(&quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/jquery&quot;) dir.create(&quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/peity&quot;) peity &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benpickles/&quot;, &quot;peity/master/jquery.peity.min.js&quot; ) jquery &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js&quot; ) download.file(jquery, &quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/jquery/jquery.min.js&quot;) download.file(peity, &quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/peity/jquery.peity.min.js&quot;) This produces a directory that looks like this: . ├── DESCRIPTION ├── NAMESPACE ├── R │ └── peity.R └── inst └── htmlwidgets ├── jquery │ └── jquery.min.js ├── peity.js ├── peity.yaml └── peity └── jquery.peity.min.js In htmlwidgets dependencies are specified in the .yml file located at inst/htmlwidgets which at first contains a commented template. # (uncomment to add a dependency) # dependencies: # - name: # version: # src: # script: # stylesheet: Let’s uncomment those lines as instructed at the top of the file and fill it in. dependencies: - name: jQuery version: 3.5.1 src: htmlwidgets/jquery script: jquery.min.js - name: peity version: 3.3.0 src: htmlwidgets/peity script: jquery.peity.min.js The order of the dependencies matters, peity.js depends on jQuery hence the latter comes first in the .yml. The order in which one specifies the dependencies matters, just like it does in an HTML file, therefore jQuery is listed first. The stylesheet entries were removed as none of these libraries require CSS files. The src path points to the directory containing the JavaScript files and stylesheets relative to the inst directory of the package, this is akin to using the system.file function to return the full path to a file or directory within the package. devtools::load_all() system.file(&quot;htmlwidgets/peity&quot;, package = &quot;peity&quot;) #&gt; &quot;/home/me/packages/peity/inst/htmlwidgets/peity&quot; We should verify that this is correct by using the one R function the package features and check the source code of the output to verify that the the dependencies are well present in the HTML output. We thus run peity(\"test\"), open the output in the browser () and look at the source code of the page. At the top of the page one should see jquery.min.js and jquery.peity.min.js imported, clicking those links will either present you with the content of the file or an error. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt; &lt;style&gt;body{background-color:white;}&lt;/style&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;lib/htmlwidgets-1.5.1/htmlwidgets.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;lib/jQuery-3.5.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;lib/peity-3.3.0/jquery.peity.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;lib/peity-binding-0.0.0.9000/peity.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; ... 6.2 Implementation Peity.js’ JavaScript code is rather uncomplicated, it’s just one function, but integrating it with htmlwidgets requires some thinking. In the example below, peity is applied to the element with id = 'elementId', the first argument of peity is the type of chart to produce form the data and the second optional argument is a JSON of options. $(&quot;#elementId&quot;).peity(&quot;bar&quot;, { fill: [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] }) Also, the data that peity uses to draw the inline chart is not passed to the function but taken from the HTML element. &lt;span id=&quot;elementId&quot;&gt;5,3,9,6&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, the htmlwidget will have to insert the data in the HTML element then run the peity function to render the chart. inserting the data is not easy as much as already done by htmlwidgets by default. Indeed the default htmlwidgets template takes a message from the R function and inserts said message in the HTML element, passing a vector instead of a message produces precisely what peity expects! peity(c(1,5,6,2)) &lt;div id=&quot;htmlwidget-495cf47d1a2a4a56c851&quot; style=&quot;width:960px;height:500px;&quot; class=&quot;play html-widget&quot;&gt; 1,5,6,2 &lt;/div&gt; The argument ought to be renamed nonetheless from message to data. peity &lt;- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # forward options using x x = list( data = data ) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;peity&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;peity&#39;, elementId = elementId ) } The change in the R code must be mirrored in the peity.js file where it should set the innerText to x.data instead of x.message. // peity.js // el.innerText = x.message; el.innerText = x.data; This leaves the implementation of peity.js to turn the data into an actual chart. The way we shall go about it is to paste one of the examples in the renderValue function. renderValue: function(x) { // insert data el.innerText = x.data; // run peity $(&quot;#elementId&quot;).peity(&quot;bar&quot;, { fill: [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] }) } One could be tempted to run devtools::load_all but this will not work, namely because the function uses a selector that is will not return any object; it needs to be applied to the div created by the widget not #elementId. As explained in the previous chapter, the selector of the element created is accessible from the el object. As a matter of fact, we did log in the browser console the id of the created div taken from el.id. Therefore concatenating the pound sign and the element id produces the select to said element (.class, #id). $(&quot;#&quot; + el.id).peity(&quot;bar&quot;, { fill: [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] }) This will work but can be further simplified, there is no need to recreate a selector using the id of the el element, the latter can be used in the jQuery selector directly. $(el).peity(&quot;bar&quot;, { fill: [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] }) This will now produce a working widget, albeit limited to creating charts of a predefined type and color. Next these options defining the chart type, fill colors and others must be made available from R. Below we add a type argument to the peity function, this type argument is then forwarded to x so it is serialised and accessible in the JavaScript file. peity &lt;- function(data, type = c(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, &quot;pie&quot;, &quot;donut&quot;), width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { type &lt;- match.arg(type) # forward options using x x = list( data = data, type = type ) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;peity&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;peity&#39;, elementId = elementId ) } This should then be applied by replacing the hard-coded type (\"bar\") to x.type. $(el).peity(x.type, { fill: [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] }) Reloading the package will now let one create a chart and define its type but some options remain hard-coded. These can be made available from R in a variety of ways depending on the interface one wants to provide users of the package. Here we simply make them available via the three-dot construct (...) which are captured in a list and forwarded to the x object. peity &lt;- function(data, type = c(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;line&quot;, &quot;pie&quot;, &quot;donut&quot;), ..., width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { type &lt;- match.arg(type) # forward options using x x = list( data = data, type = type, options = list(...) ) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;peity&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;peity&#39;, elementId = elementId ) } These can then be easily accessed from JavaScript. $(el).peity(x.type, x.options) This makes (nearly) all of the functionalities of peity.js available from R. Below we use htmltools::browsable to create multiple widgets at once, the function only accepts a single value so the charts are wrapped in an htmltools::tagList. Let’s explain those in reverse order, tagList accepts a group of tags or valid HTML outputs like htmlwidgets and wraps them into one, it is necessary here because the function browsable only accepts one value. Normally htmltools tags are just printed in the console, here we need them to be opened in the browser instead. Remember to run devtools::load_all so you can run the peity function we just wrote. library(htmltools) browsable( tagList( peity(runif(5)), peity(runif(5), type = &quot;line&quot;), peity(&quot;1/4&quot;, type = &quot;pie&quot;, fill = c(&quot;#c6d9fd&quot;, &quot;#4d89f9&quot;)), peity(c(3,5), type = &quot;donut&quot;) ) ) FIGURE 6.1: Peity output with DIV There is nonetheless one remaining issue: peity.js is meant to create inline charts within &lt;span&gt; HTML tags but these are created within &lt;div&gt; hence each chart appears on a new line. 6.3 HTML Element As pointed out multiple times, the widget is generated in a &lt;div&gt;, which is works fine for most visualisation libraries. But we saw that peity.js works best when placed in a &lt;span&gt; as this allows placing the charts inline. This can be changed by placing a function named widgetname_html which is looked up by htmlwidgets and used if found. This is probably the first such function one encounters and is rather uncommon but it is literally how the htmlwidgets package does it: it scans the namespace of the package looking for a function that starts with the name of the widget and ends in _html and if found uses it, otherwise it uses the default div. This function takes the three-dot construct (...) and uses them in an htmltools tag. The three-dots are necessary because internally htmlwidgets needs be able to pass the id, class, and style attributes to the tag. peity_html &lt;- function(...){ htmltools::tags$span(...) } This can also come in handy if some arguments must be hard-coded such as assigning a specific class to every widget. myWidget_html &lt;- function(..., class){ htmltools::tags$div(..., class = c(class, &quot;my-class&quot;)) } Reloading the package after placing the function above anywhere in the package will produce inline charts. browsable( tagList( p( &quot;We can now&quot;, peity(runif(5)), &quot;use peity&quot;, peity(runif(5), type = &quot;line&quot;), &quot;inline with text!&quot;, peity(c(4,2), type = &quot;donut&quot;) ) ) ) FIGURE 6.2: Peity output with SPAN "],["widgets-full.html", "Chapter 7 The Full Monty 7.1 Dependencies 7.2 JavaScript 7.3 Working with Data 7.4 Transforming Data 7.5 On Print Method", " Chapter 7 The Full Monty With a first widget built one can jump onto another one: gio.js, a library to draw arcs between countries on a 3 dimensional globe. This will include many more functionalities such packages can comprise. Then again, the first order of business when looking to integrate a library is to look at the documentation to understand what should be reproduced in R. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Import libraries --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;three.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;gio.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- div to hold visualisation --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;globe&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Script to create visualisation --&gt; &lt;script&gt; var container = document.getElementById(&quot;globe&quot;); var controller = new GIO.Controller(container); controller.addData(data); controller.init(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; FIGURE 7.1: Gio.js example Gio.js has itself a dependency, three.js, which needs to be imported before gio.js, other than that not much differs from libraries previously explored in this chapter. usethis::create_package(&quot;gio&quot;) htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget(&quot;gio&quot;) 7.1 Dependencies Handling the dependencies does not differ much, we create the directories within the inst path and download the dependencies within them. # create directories for JS dependencies dir.create(&quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/three&quot;, recursive = TRUE) dir.create(&quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/gio&quot;, recursive = TRUE) # download JS dependencies three &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/&quot;, &quot;libs/three.js/110/three.min.js&quot; ) gio &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&quot;, &quot;syt123450/giojs/master/build/gio.min.js&quot; ) download.file(three, &quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/three/three.min.js&quot;) download.file(gio, &quot;./inst/htmlwidgets/gio/gio.min.js&quot;) This should produce the following working directory. . ├── DESCRIPTION ├── NAMESPACE ├── R │ └── gio.R └── inst └── htmlwidgets ├── gio │ └── gio.min.js ├── gio.js ├── gio.yaml └── three └── three.min.js The libraries have been downloaded but the gio.yml file is yet to be edited. The order in which the libraries are listed matters; just as in HTML three.js needs to precede gio.js as the latter depends on the former and not vice versa. dependencies: - name: three version: 110 src: htmlwidgets/three script: three.min.js - name: gio version: 2.0 src: htmlwidgets/gio script: gio.min.js 7.2 JavaScript Let’s copy the JavaScript code from the Get Started section of gio.js in the gio.js file’s renderValue function. At this point the data format is not known so we comment the line which adds data to the visualisation. // gio.js HTMLWidgets.widget({ name: &#39;gio&#39;, type: &#39;output&#39;, factory: function(el, width, height) { // TODO: define shared variables for this instance return { renderValue: function(x) { var container = document.getElementById(&quot;globe&quot;); var controller = new GIO.Controller(container); //controller.addData(data); controller.init(); }, resize: function(width, height) { // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size } }; } }); One can document and load the package but it will not work as the code above attempts to place the visualisation in a div with id = \"globe\". As for the previously written widget, this needs to be changed to el.id. // gio.js renderValue: function(x) { var container = document.getElementById(el.id); var controller = new GIO.Controller(container); //controller.addData(data); controller.init(); } At this stage the widget should generate a visualisation. devtools::document() devtools::load_all() gio(message = &quot;This required but not used&quot;) FIGURE 7.2: Gio output without data Not too shabby given how little work was put into this! Before we move on let us optimise something. In the JavaScript code we retrieve the container using el.id but this in effect is very inefficient: el is identical to container. // gio.js renderValue: function(x) { var controller = new GIO.Controller(el); //controller.addData(data); controller.init(); } 7.3 Working with Data An interesting start, now onto adding data. Let’s take a look at the documentation to see what data the library expects. [ { &quot;e&quot;: &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;i&quot;: &quot;US&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: 3300000 }, { &quot;e&quot;: &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;i&quot;: &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: 10000 } ] The JSON data should constitutes of arrays that denote arcs to draw on the globe where each arc is defined by an exporting country (e), an importing country (i), and is given a value (v). The importing and exporting country, the source and target of the arc, are indicated by ISO alpha-2 country codes. We can read this JSON into R. # data.frame to test arcs &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON( &#39;[ { &quot;e&quot;: &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;i&quot;: &quot;US&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: 3300000 }, { &quot;e&quot;: &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;i&quot;: &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: 10000 } ]&#39; ) print(arcs) #&gt; e i v #&gt; 1 CN US 3300000 #&gt; 2 CN RU 10000 Jsonlite automagically converts the JSON into a data frame where each row is an arc, which is great as R users tend to prefer rectangular data over lists: this is probably what the package should use as input too. Let us make some changes to the gio function so it takes data as input. gio &lt;- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # forward options using x x = list( data = data ) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId ) } This must be reflected in the play.js file where we uncomment the line previously commented and use x.data passed from R. // gio.js renderValue: function(x) { var controller = new GIO.Controller(el); controller.addData(x.data); // uncomment &amp; use x.data controller.init(); } We can now use the function with the data to plot arcs! devtools::document() devtools::load_all() gio(arcs) Unfortunately, this breaks everything and we are presented with a blank screen. Using console.log or looking at the source code the rendered widget reveals the problem: the data isn’t actually in the correct format! {&quot;x&quot;:{&quot;data&quot;:{&quot;e&quot;:[&quot;CN&quot;,&quot;CN&quot;],&quot;i&quot;:[&quot;US&quot;,&quot;RU&quot;],&quot;v&quot;:[3300000,10000]}},&quot;evals&quot;:[],&quot;jsHooks&quot;:[]} Htmlwidgets actually serialised the data frame column-wise (long) where each array is a column, whereas gio.js expect the data to be wide (row-wise serialisation) where each array is a arc (row). # column-wise jsonlite::toJSON(arcs, dataframe = &quot;columns&quot;) #&gt; {&quot;e&quot;:[&quot;CN&quot;,&quot;CN&quot;],&quot;i&quot;:[&quot;US&quot;,&quot;RU&quot;],&quot;v&quot;:[3300000,10000]} # row-wise jsonlite::toJSON(arcs, dataframe = &quot;rows&quot;) #&gt; [{&quot;e&quot;:&quot;CN&quot;,&quot;i&quot;:&quot;US&quot;,&quot;v&quot;:3300000},{&quot;e&quot;:&quot;CN&quot;,&quot;i&quot;:&quot;RU&quot;,&quot;v&quot;:10000}] As mentioned previously, convention has it that rectangular data (data frames) are serialised row-wise. This is likely to be a recurring problem for many widgets. 7.4 Transforming Data There are multiple ways to transform the data and ensure the serialised JSON is as the JavaScript library expects it to be. The following sections explore those various methods before settling on a specific one for the gio package. 7.4.1 Using JavaScript JavaScript can be used to transform the data, thereby leaving the serialiser as-is only to reshape it in the client. The HTMLwidget JavaScript library (already imported by default) exports an object which provides a method, dataframeToD3, to transform the data from long to wide. // gio.js renderValue: function(x) { // long to wide x.data = HTMLWidgets.dataframeToD3(x.data); var controller = new GIO.Controller(el); controller.addData(x.data); controller.init(); } 7.4.2 Modify Serialiser Instead of serialising the data a certain way then correct it in JavaScript as demonstrated previously, one can also modify, or even replace, htmlwidgets’ default serialiser. Speaking of which, below is the default serializer used by htmlwidgets. function (x, ..., dataframe = &quot;columns&quot;, null = &quot;null&quot;, na = &quot;null&quot;, auto_unbox = TRUE, use_signif = TRUE, digits = getOption(&quot;shiny.json.digits&quot;, 16), force = TRUE, POSIXt = &quot;ISO8601&quot;, UTC = TRUE, rownames = FALSE, keep_vec_names = TRUE, strict_atomic = TRUE) { if (strict_atomic) x &lt;- I(x) jsonlite::toJSON(x, dataframe = dataframe, null = null, na = na, auto_unbox = auto_unbox, digits = digits, force = force, use_signif = use_signif, POSIXt = POSIXt, UTC = UTC, rownames = rownames, keep_vec_names = keep_vec_names, json_verbatim = TRUE, ...) } The problem at hand is caused by the dataframe argument which is set to columns where it should be set rows (for row-wise). Arguments are passed to the serialiser indirectly, in the form of a list set as TOJSON_ARGS attribute to the object x that is serialised. We could thus change the gio function to reflect the aforementioned change. gio &lt;- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # forward options using x x = list( data = data ) # serialise data.frames to wide (not long as default) attr(x, &#39;TOJSON_ARGS&#39;) &lt;- list(dataframe = &quot;rows&quot;) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId ) } The above may appear confusing at first as one rarely encounters the attr replacement function. attr(cars, &quot;hello&quot;) &lt;- &quot;world&quot; # set attr(cars, &quot;hello&quot;) # get #&gt; [1] &quot;world&quot; Other arguments can be placed in the same list, they will ultimately reach the serialiser to modify its output. 7.4.3 Replace Serialiser Otherwise the serializer can also be replaced in its entirety, also by setting an attribute, TOJSON_FUNC, to the x object. Below the serialiser is changed to jsonify (Cooley 2020) which by default serialises data frames to wide, unlike htmlwidgets’ serialiser, thereby also fixing the issue. gio &lt;- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # forward options using x x = list( data = data ) # replace serialiser attr(x, &#39;TOJSON_FUNC&#39;) &lt;- gio_serialiser # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId ) } # serialiser gio_serialiser &lt;- function(x){ jsonify::to_json(x, unbox = TRUE) } 7.4.4 Modify the Data Alternatively, one can also leave all serialisers-related options unchanged and instead format the data in R prior to the serialisation, changing the dataframe to a row-wise list. x = list( data = apply(data, 1, as.list) ) The above would make it such that the serialiser no longer has to interpret how the data should be serialised (row-wise or column-wise), the data now being a list will be serialised correctly. 7.4.5 Pros &amp; Cons There are pros and cons to each methods. The preferable method is probably to only alter the default serialiser where needed, this is the method used in the remainder of the book. Replacing the serialiser in its entirety should not be necessary, only do this once you are very familiar with serialisation and truly see a need for it. Moreover htmlwidgets’ serialiser extends jsonlite to allow converting JavaScript code which will come in handy later on. Transforming the data in JavaScript has one drawback, HTMLWidgets.dataframeToD3 cannot be applied to the entire x object, it will only work on the subsets that hold the column-wise data (x.data) which tends to lead to clunky code as one uses said function in various places. FIGURE 7.3: Gio output with correct serialisation 7.5 On Print Method Let’s add the option to style the globe, gio.js provides mutliple themes but they are currently not applicable from R. As a matter of fact, gio.js provides dozens of customisation options that should be available in the package as well. These, however, probably should be split across different functions, just like they are in gio.js, rather than all be accessible from a single function containing hundreds of arguments. This begs the question, when would one use another function given the function gio generates the visualisation? As it happens gio itself (or rather the function htmlwidgets::createWidget it contains) does not render the output, it returns an object of class “htmlwidget” which actually renders the visualisation on print (literally htmlwidget.print method). g &lt;- gio(arcs) # nothing renders g # visualisation renders Therefore, one can use functions on the object returned by gio which contains, amongst other things, the x list to which we can make changes, append data, or do any other operation that standard R lists allow. print(g$x) ## $data ## e i v ## 1 CN US 3300000 ## 2 CN RU 10000 ## ## attr(,&quot;TOJSON_ARGS&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;TOJSON_ARGS&quot;)$dataframe ## [1] &quot;rows&quot; This clarified the function to change the style of the visualisation can be added to the package. It would take as input the output of gio and append the style (name of theme) to the x list, this would then be used in JavaScript to change the look of the visualisation. #&#39; @export gio_style &lt;- function(g, style = &quot;magic&quot;){ g$x$style &lt;- style return(g) } The style is applied using the setStyle method on the controller before the visualisation is created, before the init method is called, using the style passed from R: x.style. // gio.js renderValue: function(x) { var controller = new GIO.Controller(el); controller.addData(x.data); controller.setStyle(x.style); // set style controller.init(); } We can now run devtools::load_all to export the newly written function and load the functions in the environment with devtools::load_all. g1 &lt;- gio(arcs) g2 &lt;- gio_style(g1, &quot;juicyCake&quot;) g2 FIGURE 7.4: Gio with a new theme This is great but can be greatly improved upon with the magrittr pipe (Bache and Wickham 2014), it would allow easily passing the output of each function to the next to obtain an API akin to that of plotly or highcharter. library(magrittr) gio(arcs) %&gt;% gio_style(&quot;juicyCake&quot;) The pipe drastically improves the API that gio provides its users and thus probably should be exported by the package; the usethis package provides a function to easily do so. # export the pipe usethis::use_pipe() This closes this chapter but is not the last we see of gio.js, we shall use it as example in the next chapters as we extend its functionalities, polish certain aspects such as sizing and security.

We look into handling the size of widgets to ensure they are responsive as well as discuss potential security concerns and how to address them. Finally we show how to pass JavaScript code from R to JavaScript and how to add HTML content before and after the widget. 8.1 Shared Variables Up until now the topic of shared variables had been omitted as it was not relevant, however, it will be from here onwards. Indeed we are about to discover how to further manipulate the widget; changing the data, resizing, and more. This will generally involve the JavaScript instance of the visualisation, the object named controller in the gio package, which, being defined in the renderValue function, is not accessible outside of it. To make it accessible outside of renderValue requires a tiny but consequential change without which resizing the widget will not be doable for instance. The controller variable has to be declared outside of the renderValue function, inside the factory. This was in fact indicated from the onset by the following comment: // TODO: define shared variables for this instance (generated by htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget). Any variable declared as shown below will be accessible by all functions declared in the factory; renderValue, but also resize and others yet to be added. HTMLWidgets.widget({ name: &#39;gio&#39;, type: &#39;output&#39;, factory: function(el, width, height) { // TODO: define shared variables for this instance var controller; return { renderValue: function(x) { controller = new GIO.Controller(el); // declared outside // add data controller.addData(x.data); // define style controller.setStyle(x.style); // render controller.init(); }, resize: function(width, height) { // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size } }; } }); 8.1.1 Sizing The gio function of the package we developed in the previous chapter has arguments to specify the dimensions of the visualisation (width and height). However, think how rarely (if ever) one specifies these parameters when using plotly, highcharter or leaflet. Indeed HTML visualisations should be responsive and fit the container they are placed in—not to be confused though, these are two different things. This enables creating visualisations that look great on large desktop screens as well as the smaller mobile phones or iPad screens. Pre-defining the dimensions of the visualisation (e.g.: 400px), breaks all responsiveness as the width is no longer relative to its container. Using a relative width like 100% ensures the visualisation always fits in the container edge to edge and enables responsiveness. arcs &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON( &#39;[ { &quot;e&quot;: &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;i&quot;: &quot;US&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: 3300000 }, { &quot;e&quot;: &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;i&quot;: &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;v&quot;: 10000 } ]&#39; ) gio(arcs) FIGURE 8.1: Gio with no sizing management When this is not specified htmlwidgets sets the width of the visualisation to 400 pixels. gio(arcs, width = 500) # 500 pixels wide gio(arcs, width = &quot;100%&quot;) # fits width These options are destined for the user of the package, the next section details how the developer can define default sizing behaviour. 8.1.2 Sizing Policy One can specify a sizing policy when creating the widget, the sizing policy will dictate default dimensions and padding given different contexts: Global defaults RStudio viewer Web browser R markdown It is often enough to specify general defaults as widgets are rarely expected to behave differently with respect to size depending on the context but it can be useful in some cases. Below we modify the sizing policy of gio via the sizingPolicy argument of the createWidget function. The function htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy has many arguments, we set the default width to 100% to ensure the visualisation fills its container entirely regardless of where it is rendered. We also remove all padding by setting it to 0 and set browser.fill to TRUE so it automatically resizes the visualisation to fit the entire browser page. # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId, sizingPolicy = htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy( defaultWidth = &quot;100%&quot;, padding = 0, browser.fill = TRUE ) ) FIGURE 8.2: Gio with sizing policy 8.2 Resizing In the first widget built in this book (playground), when we deconstructed the JavaScript factory function but omitted the resize function. The resize function does what it says on the tin: it is called when the widget is resized. What this function will contain entirely depends on the JavaScript library one is working with. Some are very easy to resize other less so, that is for the developer to discover in the documentation of the library. Some libraries, like gio, do not even require using a resizing function and handle that automatically under the hood; resize the width of the RStudio viewer or web browser and gio.js resizes too. This said, there is a function to force resize gio, though it is not in the official documentation it can be found in the source code: resizeUpdate is a method of the controller and does not take any argument. ... resize: function(width, height) { controller.resizeUpdate(); } ... FIGURE 8.3: Gio resized To give the reader a better idea of what these tend to look like below are the ways plotly, highcharts, and chart.js do it. Plotly Plotly.relayout(&#39;chartid&#39;, {width: width, height: height}); Highcharts chart.setSize(width, height); Chart.js chart.resize(); Note that the width and height used in the functions above are obtained from the resize function itself (see arguments). That is one of the reasons for ensuring the instance of the visualisation (controller in this case) is shared (declared in factory), if declared in the renderValue function then the resize function cannot access that object and thus cannot run the function required to resize the widget. 8.3 Pre Render Hooks &amp; Security The createWidget function also comes with a preRenderHook argument which accepts a function that is run just prior to the rendering of the widget (in R, not JavaScript), this function should accept the entire widget object as input, and should return a modified widget object. This was not used in any of the widgets previously built but is extremely useful. It can be used to make checks on the object to ensure all is correct, or remove variables that should only be used internally, and much more. Currently, gio takes the data frame data and serialises it in its entirety which will cause security concerns as all the data used in the widget is visible in the source code of the output. What if the data used for the visualisation contained an additional column with sensitive information? We ought to ensure gio only serialises the data necessary to produce the visualisation. # add a variable that should not be shared arcs$secret_id &lt;- 1:2 We create a render_gio function which accepts the entire widget, filters only the column necessary from the data and returns the widget. This function is then passed to the argument preRenderHook of the htmlwidgets::createWidget call. This way, only the columns e, v, and i of the data are kept thus the secret_id column will not be exposed publicly. # preRenderHook function render_gio &lt;- function(g){ # only keep relevant variables g$x$data &lt;- g$x$data[,c(&quot;e&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;i&quot;)] return(g) } # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId, sizingPolicy = htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy( defaultWidth = &quot;100%&quot;, padding = 0, browser.fill = TRUE ), preRenderHook = render_gio # pass renderer ) Moreover, security aside, this can also improve performances as only the data relevant to the visualisation is serialised and subsequently loaded by the client. Without the modification above, were one to use gio on a dataset with 100 columns all would have been serialised, thereby greatly impacting performances both of the R process rendering the output and the web browser viewing the visualisation. 8.4 JavaScript Code As mentioned in a previous chapter JavaScript code cannot be serialised to JSON. # serialised as string jsonlite::toJSON(&quot;var x = 3;&quot;) #&gt; [&quot;var x = 3;&quot;] Nonetheless, it is doable with htmlwidgets’ serialiser (and only that one). The function htmlwidgets::JS can be used to mark a character vector so that it will be treated as JavaScript code when evaluated in the browser. htmlwidgets::JS(&quot;var x = 3;&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;var x = 3;&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;JS_EVAL&quot; This can be useful where the library requires the use of callback functions for instance. Replacing the serialiser will break this feature. 8.5 Prepend &amp; Append Content There is the ability to append of prepend HTML content to the widget (shiny, htmltools tags, or a list of those). For instance, we could use htmlwidgets::prependContent to allow displaying a title to the visualisation as shown below. #&#39; @export gio_title &lt;- function(g, title){ title &lt;- htmltools::h3(title) htmlwidgets::prependContent(g, title) } gio(arcs) %&gt;% gio_title(&quot;Gio.js htmlwidget!&quot;) FIGURE 8.4: Gio output with title While the prependContent function places the content above the visualisation, the appendContent function places it below, as they accept any valid htmltools or shiny tag they can also be used for conditional CSS styling for instance. prependContent and appendContent do not work in shiny. 8.6 Dependencies Thus far, this book has only covered one of two ways dependencies can be included in htmlwidgets. Though the one covered, using the .yml file, will likely be necessary for every widget it has one drawback: all dependencies listed in the file are always included with the output. Dependencies can greatly affect the load time of the output (be it a standalone visualisation, an R markdown document, or a shiny application) as these files may be large. Most large visualisation libraries will therefore allow to bundle those dependencies in separate files. For instance, ECharts.js provides a way to customise the bundle to only include dependencies for charts that one wants to draw (e.g.: bar chart, or boxplot), Highcharts also allows splitting dependencies so one can load those needed for maps, stock charts, and more, separately. It is thus good practice to do the same in widgets so only the required dependencies are loaded, e.g.: when the user produces a map, only the dependency for that map is loaded. It is used in the leaflet package to load map tiles for instance. The Google Chrome network tab shows information on resources downloaded by the browser (including dependencies) including how long it takes. It is advisable to take a look at it to ensure no dependency drags load time. FIGURE 8.5: Google Chrome network tab To demonstrate, we will add a function in gio to optionally include stats.js, a JavaScript performance monitor which displays information such as the number of frames per second (FPS) rendered, or the number of milliseconds needed to render the visualisation. Gio.js natively supports stats.js but the dependency needs to be imported and that option needs to be enabled on the controller as shown in the documentation. // enable stats controller.enableStats(); In htmlwidgets those additional dependencies can be specified via the dependencies argument in the htmlwidgets::createWidget function, or they can be appended to the output of that function. # create gio object g &lt;- gio::gio(arcs) is.null(g$dependencies) [1] TRUE As shown above, the object created by gio includes dependencies, currently NULL as no such extra dependency is specified. One can therefore append those to that object in a fashion similar to what the gio_style function does. From the root of the gio package we create a new directory for the stats.js dependency and download the latest version from Github. dir.create(&quot;htmlwidgets/stats&quot;) url &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/&quot;, &quot;stats.js/master/build/stats.min.js&quot; ) download.file(url, destfile = &quot;htmlwidgets/stats/stats.min.js&quot;) First we use the system.file function to retrieve the path to the directory which contains the dependency (stats.min.js). It’s important that it is the path to the directory and not the file itself. # stats.R gio_stats &lt;- function(g){ # create dependency path &lt;- system.file(&quot;htmlwidgets/stats&quot;, package = &quot;gio&quot;) return(g) } Then we use the htmltools package to create a dependency, the htmltools::htmlDependency function returns an object of class html_dependency which htmlwidgets can understand and subsequently insert in the output. On the src parameter, since we reference a dependency from the filesystem we name the character string file but we could use the CDN (web hosted file) and name it href instead. # stats.R gio_stats &lt;- function(g){ # create dependency path &lt;- system.file(&quot;htmlwidgets/stats&quot;, package = &quot;gio&quot;) dep &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;stats&quot;, version = &quot;17&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = &quot;stats.min.js&quot; ) return(g) } The dependency then needs to be appended to the htmlwidgets object. # stats.R gio_stats &lt;- function(g){ # create dependency path &lt;- system.file(&quot;htmlwidgets/stats&quot;, package = &quot;gio&quot;) dep &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;stats&quot;, version = &quot;17&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = &quot;stats.min.js&quot; ) # append dependency g$dependencies &lt;- append(g$dependencies, list(dep)) return(g) } Finally, we pass an additional variable in the list of options (x) which we will use JavaScript-side to check whether stats.js must be enabled. #&#39; @export gio_stats &lt;- function(g){ # create dependency path &lt;- system.file(&quot;htmlwidgets/stats&quot;, package = &quot;gio&quot;) dep &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;stats&quot;, version = &quot;17&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = &quot;stats.min.js&quot; ) # append dependency to gio.js g$dependencies &lt;- append(g$dependencies, list(dep)) # add stats variable g$x$stats &lt;- TRUE return(g) } Then it’s a matter of using the stats variable added to x in the JavaScript renderValue function to determine whether the stats feature should be enabled. // gio.js if(x.stats) controller.enableStats(); controller.init(); Then the package can be documented to export the newly created function and loaded in the environment to test the feature. # create gio object arcs %&gt;% gio() %&gt;% gio_stats() FIGURE 8.6: Gio with stats output In brief, it is better to only place the hard dependencies in the .yml file; dependencies that are absolutely necessary to producing the visualisation and use dynamic dependencies where ever possible. Perhaps one can think of it as the difference between Imports and Suggests in an R package DESCRIPTION file. 8.7 Compatibility One issue that might arise is that of compatibility between widgets. What if someone else builds another htmlwidget for gio.js which uses a different version of the library and that a user decides to use both packages in a shiny app or R markdown document? Something is likely to fail as two different version of gio.js are imported and that one overrides the other. For instance, the package echarts4r (Coene 2020a) allows working with leaflet but including the dependencies could clash with the leaflet package itself, therefore it uses the dependencies from the leaflet package instead. The htmlwidgets package comes with a function to extract the dependencies from a widget, so they can be reused in another. The function htmlwidgets::getDependency returns a list of objects of class html_dependency which can therefore be used in other widgets as demonstrated in the previous section. # get dependencies of the gio package htmlwidgets::getDependency(&quot;gio&quot;)[2:3] #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; List of 10 #&gt; $ name : chr &quot;three&quot; #&gt; $ version : chr &quot;110&quot; #&gt; $ src :List of 1 #&gt; ..$ file: chr &quot;/home/jp/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/gio/htmlwidgets/three&quot; #&gt; $ meta : NULL #&gt; $ script : chr &quot;three.min.js&quot; #&gt; $ stylesheet: NULL #&gt; $ head : NULL #&gt; $ attachment: NULL #&gt; $ package : NULL #&gt; $ all_files : logi TRUE #&gt; - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;html_dependency&quot; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; List of 10 #&gt; $ name : chr &quot;gio&quot; #&gt; $ version : chr &quot;2&quot; #&gt; $ src :List of 1 #&gt; ..$ file: chr &quot;/home/jp/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.0/gio/htmlwidgets/gio&quot; #&gt; $ meta : NULL #&gt; $ script : chr &quot;gio.min.js&quot; #&gt; $ stylesheet: NULL #&gt; $ head : NULL #&gt; $ attachment: NULL #&gt; $ package : NULL #&gt; $ all_files : logi TRUE #&gt; - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;html_dependency&quot; 8.8 Unit Tests The best way to write unit tests for htmlwidgets is to test the object created by htmlwidgets::createWidget. Below we provide an example using testthat(Wickham 2020), running expect* functions on the output of gio. library(gio) library(testthat) test_that(&quot;gio has correct data&quot;, { g &lt;- gio(arcs) # internally stored as data.frame expect_is(g$x$data, &quot;data.frame&quot;) # gio does not work without data expect_error(gio()) }) 8.9 Performances A few hints have already been given to ensure one does not drain the browser, consider assessing the performances of the widget as it is being built. Always try and imagine what happens under the hood of the htmlwidget as you build it, it often reveals potential bottlenecks and solutions. Remember that data passed to htmlwidgets::createWidget is 1) loaded into R, 2) serialised to JSON, 3) embedded into the HTML output, 4) read back in with JavaScript, which adds some overhead considering it might be read into JavaScript directly. This will not be a problem for most visualisations but might become one when that data is large. Indeed, there are sometimes more efficient ways to load data into web browsers where it is needed for the visualisation. Consider for instance geographic features (topoJSON and GeoJSON), why load them into R if it is to then re-serialise it to JSON? Also keep the previous remark in mind when repeatedly serialising identical data objects, GeoJSON is again a good example. A map used twice or more should only be serialised once or better not at all. Consider providing other ways to for the developer to make potentially large data files accessible to the browser. Below is an example of function that could be used within R markdown or shiny UI to load data in the front-end and bypass serialisation. Additionally the function makes use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) to asynchronously load the data, thereby further reducing load time. # this would placed in the shiny UI load_json_from_ui &lt;- function(path_to_json){ script &lt;- paste0(&quot; $.ajax({ url: &#39;&quot;, path_to_json, &quot;&#39;, dataType: &#39;json&#39;, async: true, success: function(data){ console.log(data); window.globalData = data; } });&quot; ) shiny::tags$script( script ) } Using the above the data loaded would be accessible from the htmlwidgets JavaScript (e.g.: gio.js) with window.globalData. The window object is akin to the document object, while the latter pertains to the Document Object Model (DOM) and represents the page, the former pertains to the Browser Object Model (BOM) and represents the browser window. While var x; will only be accessible within the script where it is declared, window.x will be accessible anywhere. Note this means the data is read from the web browser and therefore the data must be accessible to the web browser, the path_to_json must thus be a served static file, e.g.: www directory in shiny.

This in effect allows the selection or filtering of data points in one widget to be mirrored in another. This is enabled with the creation of “shared datasets” that can be used across widgets; outputs that share datasets share interactions. Crosstalk provides a straightforward interface to the users and instead requires effort from developers for their widgets to support shared datasets. 9.1 Crosstalk Examples Both the plotly and DT packages support crosstalk, therefore using a shared dataset we can produce a scatter plot with the former and a table with the latter so that selection of data in one is reflected in the other. As alluded to earlier on this can be achieved by using a shared dataset which can be created with the SharedData R6 class from the crosstalk package, this dataset is then used as one would use a standard dataframe in plotly and DT. The bscols function is just a helper to create columns from html elements (using bootstrap). It’s ideal for examples but one should not have to use it in Shiny—crosstalk will work without bscols. library(DT) library(plotly) library(crosstalk) shared &lt;- SharedData$new(cars) bscols( plot_ly(shared, x = ~speed, y=~dist), datatable(shared, width = &quot;100%&quot;) ) FIGURE 9.1: Crosstalk example Basic usage of crosstalk datasets in shiny is also straightforward since it accepts reactive expressions to create shared datasets. \"Note that it takes the expression itself (expression) not the output of the expression (expression()), the crosstalk documentation explains it best: If this feels foreign to you, think of how you pass a function name, not a function call, to lapply; that’s exactly analogous to what we’re doing here. — Official Crosstalk documentation library(DT) library(shiny) library(plotly) library(crosstalk) ui &lt;- fluidPage( selectInput( &quot;specie&quot;, &quot;Specie&quot;, choices = c(&quot;setosa&quot;, &quot;versicolor&quot;, &quot;virginica&quot;) ), fluidRow( column(6, DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;)), column(6, plotlyOutput(&quot;plot&quot;)) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { reactive_data &lt;- reactive({ iris[iris$Species == input$specie, ] }) sd &lt;- SharedData$new(reactive_data) output$table &lt;- renderDT({ datatable(sd) }, server = FALSE) output$plot &lt;- renderPlotly({ plot_ly(sd, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Sepal.Width) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) When working with shiny create the shared dataset in the server function or some things that follow might not work as expected. One can also use the data method on the crosstalk object in reactive expressions, which allows accessing the Javascript selection where crosstalk is not directly supported, like below in a custom UI block. Note that the argument withSelection is set to TRUE in order to retrieve the selection state of the rows. library(DT) library(shiny) library(crosstalk) ui &lt;- fluidPage( fluidRow( column(4, uiOutput(&quot;text&quot;)), column(8, DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;)) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { sd &lt;- SharedData$new(cars) output$text &lt;- renderUI({ # get selected rows n_selected &lt;- sd$data(withSelection = TRUE) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(selected_ == TRUE) %&gt;% nrow() h3(n_selected, &quot;selected items&quot;) }) output$table &lt;- renderDT({ datatable(sd) }, server = FALSE) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 9.2: Shiny with crosstalk Using crosstalk with shiny one can also change the selection server-side with the selection method, passing it the keys to select. library(DT) library(shiny) library(crosstalk) ui &lt;- fluidPage( fluidRow( column(4, actionButton(&quot;random&quot;, &quot;Select a random row&quot;)), column(8, DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;)) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { sd &lt;- SharedData$new(cars) output$table &lt;- renderDT({ datatable(sd) }, server = FALSE) selected &lt;- c() observeEvent(input$random, { smp &lt;- c(1:50)[!1:50 %in% selected] selected &lt;&lt;- append(selected, sample(smp, 1)) sd$selection(selected) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) 9.2 Crosstalk Requirements Crosstalk is will not work well with every widget and every dataset, in some cases it might not even be a good idea to support it at all. Crosstalk works best on rectangular data: dataframes or objects that resemble dataframes like tibble or SpatialPolygonsDataFrame. This is important as crosstalk will treat the data rowwise, where each row is an observation that is ultimately selected, or filtered. If the underlying data is not tabular (e.g.: trees) then one might eventually encounter mismatches between widgets as they go out of sync. Other than tabular data, crosstalk will require the widget to have the necessary functions or methods to dispatch the selection and filtering that crosstalk enables, that is, the widget must be able to filter as well as highlight and fade selected data points as crosstalk itself does not provide this, neither the JavaScript nor the interface tools. 9.3 How it Works As will be discovered later when support for crosstalk is brought to gio, very little changes on the R side. As might be expected, crosstalk enables communication between widgets via JavaScript, hence much of what must be adapted by widgets developers happens in JavaScript too. Indeed the bi-directional communication between widgets works in the RStudio viewer, R markdown, Shiny and elsewhere, clearly indicating that all of it is taking place in the browser. 9.3.1 Keys This internally works with keys that are assigned to every row of the dataframe which enable crosstalk to track which are selected or filtered. When creating a shared dataset crosstalk will by default use the row names of the data.frame, and if these are not available the SharedData function will create row numbers. sd_cars &lt;- SharedData$new(cars[1:2,]) You can therefore mentally represent the above shared dataset as the table, note the emphasis, internally crosstalk does not actually add a column to the dataset: it leaves it as-is. key speed dist 1 4 2 2 4 10 3 7 4 4 7 22 5 8 16 The keys assigned can be retrieve with the key method on the shared dataset itself. sd_cars$key() #&gt; [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; Otherwise these keys can be explicitly set by the user when creating the package. # assign keys df &lt;- data.frame(x = runif(5)) sd &lt;- SharedData$new(df, key = letters[1:5]) sd$key() #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; 9.3.2 Communication Lines In a sense, while crosstalk establishes lines of communication to transport keys between widgets, developers of the respective widgets must handle what keys are sent to other widgets and what to do with incoming keys (that are selected or filtered in other widgets). There are two such lines of communication, one for keys of rows to be filtered, meant to narrow down the selection of data points displayed on a widget, and another for selection (what crosstalk refers to as “linked brushing”) to highlight certain data points (fading out other data points). In JavaScript, a widget “receives” the keys of selected and filtered data points and must, when filtering or selection is observed, “send” said selected or filtered keys to other widgets. 9.3.3 Groups Internally crosstalk knows what to share across widgets with groups groups share keys and are isolated from each other so one can use multiple different shared datasets without them interfering with each other. Crosstalk groups share keys. Therefore, the code below creates two shared datasets that are linked and share keys as they fall in the same group despite the fact that they are separate R objects. shared_cars &lt;- SharedData$new(mtcars, group = &quot;cars&quot;) shared_cars_head &lt;- SharedData$new(head(mtcars), group = &quot;cars&quot;) 9.4 Crosstalk with Gio The application of crosstalk to the gio library is somewhat amiss but this makes it rather more instructive as it requires thinking beyond the mere implementation of the crosstalk and is an exercise the reader will likely have to do when incorporating it to other widgets. As mentioned before, in order for crosstalk to be properly implemented a widget must be a able to select, deselect as well as filter and unfilter data points and this is not entirely the case of gio. First, gio’s underlying data is somewhat uncommon: it is a network defined only by its edges (the arcs leaving and coming into countries). Second, those edges themselves cannot be selected, as we’ve observed previously what edges are drawn on the globe cannot directly be defined, the selected country can be changed which only by proxy changes the edges shown on the globe. Third, while gio supports changing which country is selected (by clicking on the globe) it does not allow unselecting a country; with gio.js a country is always selected. The way crosstalk can work with gio is by setting the keys of the shared dataset to the country ISO codes that gio uses. Since data gio accepts consists of edges this ISO code could correspond to either the source or the target country. # keys = target shared_arcs &lt;- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$e) # keys = source shared_arcs &lt;- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$i) This constraint would have to be documented and communicated to the users of the package as otherwise gio’s implementation of crosstalk will not work. Were the constraint of having to specify the keys removed the gio package would have to interpret the keys. For instance, the widget would receive a selection, say 3 indicating that the third edge was selected in another widget, gio, not being able to highlight the edge, would have decide whether to highlight either the country where the edge comes from or the country where the edge goes to. Though this could be implemented it would be vastly more laborious and in fact be more limited as the choice of country to highlight would no longer up to the user. 9.5 R code In any event, let us start by making the required changes to the R code first. The only changes that need to be made are in the gio function as it is the only that currently accepts a dataframe and thus may receive a shared dataset. class(shared_arcs) #&gt; [1] &quot;SharedData&quot; &quot;R6&quot; Shared datasets are R6 classes and therefore cannot simply be treated as dataframes. The gio function needs to check whether the data object it received is a shared dataset with is.SharedData and if so use its methods to extract data from it, namely: The original dataset with origData The group to which the dataset belongs with groupName The keys that were assigned to every row of the dataset with key The origData method is needed to extract original dataframe from the shared dataset. This is of course necessary as the gio function still needs to obtain and serialise the arcs to display on the globe. # original data shared_arcs$origData() #&gt; e i v #&gt; 1 CN US 3300000 #&gt; 2 CN RU 10000 The gio function also has to extract the group to which the dataset belongs, this will be necessary JavaScript-side to tell crosstalk which group one is working with. Note that it was randomly generated since none were specified when the shared dataset was created. # groupName shared_arcs$groupName() #&gt; [1] &quot;SharedData3fbed3cf&quot; # keys shared_arcs$key() #&gt; [1] &quot;US&quot; &quot;RU&quot; The methods origData and groupName must be used in every widget, the key method may not be of use to every widget, it can be immensely useful if the visualisation library also comes with a key/id system so one can use it internally, gio.js does not and we thus will not be using it. The name of the group is passed to the x object so it is accessible JavaScript-side where it is needed, we also add the JavaScript dependency required to run crosstalk with crosstalkLibs. gio &lt;- function(data, width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # defaults to NULL group &lt;- NULL deps &lt;- NULL # uses crosstalk if (crosstalk::is.SharedData(data)) { group &lt;- data$groupName() data &lt;- data$origData() deps &lt;- crosstalk::crosstalkLibs() } # forward options using x x = list( data = data, style = &quot;default&quot;, crosstalk = list(group = group) # pass group ) attr(x, &#39;TOJSON_ARGS&#39;) &lt;- list(dataframe = &quot;rows&quot;) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId, sizingPolicy = htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy( padding = 0, browser.fill = TRUE, defaultWidth = &quot;100%&quot; ), preRenderHook = render_gio, # add crosstalk dependency dependencies = deps ) } One could improve upon this section by using creating methods on the gio function, it would make for cleaner code but this is outside the scope of this book. 9.6 JavaScript code What is left to do is to adapt the JavaScript code, as a reminder it must accept the keys selected in other widgets and share the selected key with other widgets. First we create the selection handler in the factory function, this is done by instantiating a new class from crosstalk.SelectionHandle. var sel_handle = new crosstalk.SelectionHandle(); Once the selection handle created it can be used in the renderValue function to set the group that was collected from R. sel_handle.setGroup(x.crosstalk.group); 9.6.1 Send Selected Keys In order for gio to share the selected country with other widgets it would first have to know which country is selected. This can be achieved with a callback function that gio supports. Most JavaScript visualisation libraries will support callbacks or events that are triggered when the user interacts with the visualisation so one can have arbitrary code run when, for example, a user clicks a point on a scatter plot, or when the user clicks the legend of a chart. What these callback functions will be and how they work will entirely depend on the library at hand. In gio.js this callback function is fired when a country is selected on the globe, it accepts two objects; one containing data on the country selected and another containing data on the related countries (the arcs coming and leaving the selected country). The documentation of gio.js gives the following example callback function. // define callback function function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { console.log(selectedCountry); // console.log(relatedCountries); } // use callback function controller.onCountryPicked(callback); {name: &quot;LIBYA&quot;, lat: 25, lon: 17, center: n, ISOCode: &quot;LY&quot;} This defines a function named callback which takes the two aforementioned objects and logs them in the JavaScript console. Then the function is passed to the controller via the onCountryPicked method which will run it every time a country is selected by the user. This callback function will be useful to send the keys to other widgets: when a user selects China send the CN key selection via crosstalk. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the keys used with the datasets for gio.js should be country ISO codes, therefore one can consider the variable selectedCountry.ISOCode as selected key. The set method from the selection handle can be used to share the selected key with other widgets. Note that this method expects either a null value or an array, a scalar value will throw an error, hence selectedCountry.ISOCode is wrapped in square brackets. function callback (selectedCountry) { sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); } controller.onCountryPicked(callback); 9.6.2 Set Selected Keys We have implemented the necessary to share the selected country with other widgets but are yet to implemented the opposite; when users select a country in another widget the selected country in gio should change too. Gio does provide a method called switchCountry to programmatically change the selected country. This can be achieved by listening to the change event on the selection handle previously created, below it is used to log the object e in order to inspect its properties. // placed in factory function sel_handle.on(&quot;change&quot;, function(e) { console.log(e); }); { oldValue: [], sender: n { _eventRelay: e, _emitter: t, _group: &quot;SharedDatac7682f87&quot;, _var: r, _varOnChangeSub: &quot;sub1&quot;, … }, value: [&quot;AE&quot;] } oldValue - the value that was previously selected (if any), this may be useful if the widget wants to calculate differences between the currently and previously selected value. sender - the selection handle instance that made the change. This is useful to compare against the selection handle of the widget and know whether the change in selection was initiated by this widget or another. It is often used to clear the selection or filtering before applying a new one when the change comes from another widget. value - the array of selected keys. Therefore event listener could make use of gio.js’ switchCountry. Note that 1) the selection cannot be cleared with gio.js, a country is always selected, and 2) one can only select one country a time, hence only accepting the first element of the selected keys with e.value[0]. // placed in factory function sel_handle.on(&quot;change&quot;, function(e) { // selection comes from another widget if (e.sender !== sel_handle) { // clear the selection // not possible with gio.js } controller.switchCountry(e.value[0]); }); 9.6.3 Recap JavaScript Code To recapitulate, this is what the JavaScript code should not look like. HTMLWidgets.widget({ name: &#39;gio&#39;, type: &#39;output&#39;, factory: function(el, width, height) { // TODO: define shared variables for this instance var controller; // create selection handle var sel_handle = new crosstalk.SelectionHandle(); // listen to change sel_handle.on(&quot;change&quot;, function(e) { if (e.sender !== sel_handle) { // clear selection } controller.switchCountry(e.value[0]); }); return { renderValue: function(x) { controller = new GIO.Controller(el); // group sel_handle.setGroup(x.crosstalk.group); // add data controller.addData(x.data); controller.setStyle(x.style); // callback function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); // send keys } controller.onCountryPicked(callback); // use stats if(x.stats) controller.enableStats(); // render controller.init(); }, resize: function(width, height) { controller.resizeUpdate(); }, }; } }); 9.7 Using Crosstalk with Gio Finally, now that gio supports shared dataset we can create a few examples to demonstrate how it can be used. The simplest way is probably to convert the edges to a shared dataset specifying either the source (i) or target (e) country codes as keys. However this is unlikely to be used this way out in the real world. In the example below selecting an edge highlights a node which is somewhat confusing. library(DT) library(gio) library(crosstalk) url &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCoene/&quot;, &quot;javascript-for-r/master/data/countries.json&quot; ) arcs &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(url) # Wrap data frame in SharedData # key is importing country sd &lt;- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$i) bscols( gio(sd), datatable(sd, width=&quot;100%&quot;, selection = &quot;single&quot;) ) FIGURE 9.3: Gio with DT using crosstalk Thankfully we can use the group argument in order to create edges and nodes that share keys and produce a more sensible link between widgets. Below we create two shared datasets with the same group name, one for the edges and another for the nodes and use one for the gio visualisation and the other for the plotly graph. library(gio) library(plotly) library(crosstalk) url &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCoene/&quot;, &quot;javascript-for-r/master/data/countries.json&quot; ) arcs &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(url) # Wrap data frame in SharedData edges_sd &lt;- SharedData$new(arcs, key = arcs$i, group = &quot;sharedGroup&quot;) # create nodes iso2c &lt;- unique(arcs$i) nodes &lt;- data.frame( country = iso2c, y = rnorm(length(iso2c)) ) nodes_sd &lt;- SharedData$new( nodes, key = nodes$country, group = &quot;sharedGroup&quot; ) bscols( plot_ly(data = nodes_sd, type = &quot;bar&quot;, x = ~country, y = ~y) %&gt;% config(displayModeBar = FALSE), gio(edges_sd) ) FIGURE 9.4: Gio and plotly using crosstalk and groups References "],["widgets-final.html", "Chapter 10 Final Revisions 10.1 Htmlwidgets &amp; Data 10.2 Plethora of Options 10.3 Interface Design", " Chapter 10 Final Revisions In this chapter we polish the API that gio presents its users and provide guidelines to best integrate other JavaScript libraries with R. 10.1 Htmlwidgets &amp; Data The gio package built thus far revolves around the gio function which expects a dataframe with three columns named e, i, and v, which is not great practice; there are great reasons why very few functions do that. First, it is unlikely that one comes across a dataset with such names in the real world thus users of the package will likely need to rename the columns of the dataset in order to use gio making the package rather unwieldy. Second, this makes understanding and approaching the gio package more complicated, it will not be evident by looking at the examples, and usage of gio. Instead gio should accept the dataframe as first argument and then the relevant columns to extract. This can be implemented in many ways ranging from arguments that accept the column names as strings to reproducing ggplot2’s aes function. Below we settle for a solution probably lying somewhere in between: using non-standard evaluation to provide arguments that accept the bare name of the columns. gio &lt;- function(data, source, target, value, ..., width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # defaults to NULL group &lt;- NULL if (crosstalk::is.SharedData(data)) { group &lt;- data$groupName() data &lt;- data$origData() } data &lt;- dplyr::select( data, i = {{ source }}, e = {{ target }}, v = {{ value }} ) # forward options using x x = list( configs = list(...), data = data, style = &quot;default&quot;, crosstalk = list(group = group) ) attr(x, &#39;TOJSON_ARGS&#39;) &lt;- list(dataframe = &quot;rows&quot;) # create widget htmlwidgets::createWidget( name = &#39;gio&#39;, x, width = width, height = height, package = &#39;gio&#39;, elementId = elementId, sizingPolicy = htmlwidgets::sizingPolicy( padding = 0, browser.fill = TRUE, defaultWidth = &quot;100%&quot; ), preRenderHook = render_gio, dependencies = crosstalk::crosstalkLibs() ) } The above changes allows documentating the input that gio accepts more clearly with roxygen2 and also makes its usage more transparent: it is now clear to users what data is required to create a visualisation and they are free to use dataframes of their choice. # mock up data countries &lt;- c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;BE&quot;, &quot;FR&quot;, &quot;DE&quot;) df &lt;- data.frame( from = countries, to = rev(countries), traded = runif(4) ) # use gio gio(df, source = from, target = to, value = traded) This small change makes the package a great deal easier to use and understand as source, and target are vastly clearer to understand than e and i. 10.2 Plethora of Options Some JavaScript libraries can be extensive and come with thousands of options that can make the port to R rather bulky, never hesitate to make use of the three dots construct (...) to make these accessible yet saving you from having to hard-code thousands of arguments. For instance gio.js accepts a JSON of options to further customise the globe. One could port all of these manually, or allow users to specify those configurations via the three-dot construct. var configs = { control: { stats: false, disableUnmentioned: false, lightenMentioned: false, inOnly: false, outOnly: false, initCountry: &quot;CN&quot;, halo: true }, color: { surface: 0xFFFFFF, selected: null, in: 0x154492, out: 0xDD380C, halo: 0xFFFFFF, background: null }, brightness: { ocean: 0.5, mentioned: 0.5, related: 0.5 } } controller = new Gio.controller(el, configs); The three dots can be added to the gio function which internally captures them in a list named configs so it can be easily referenced in JavaScript. # add ...three dots gio &lt;- function(data, source, target, value, ..., width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) { # ... start of the function # forward options using x x = list( configs = list(...), # pass to configs data = data, style = &quot;default&quot;, crosstalk = list(group = group) ) # ... end of the function } In JavaScript, use the configs when initialising the visualisation. // use x.configs controller = new GIO.Controller(el, x.configs); Below those configuration options are now used to set the initially selected country to the United States and change the colour of the selected country to red. gio( df, from, to, traded, control = list(initCountry = &#39;US&#39;), color = list(selected = &#39;#ff4d4d&#39;) ) FIGURE 10.1: Gio and plenty of options 10.3 Interface Design As you develop a wrapper to an external visualisation library you will have to make design choices. In building gio we more or less mirrored the JavaScript code one to one: where there is a JavaScript function to change the theme of the visualisation there is one in R, etc. This might not scale properly as more and more functions are added to the package. As observed the gio.js library has a function named setStyle to change the theme of the visualisation but it has numerous others, setSurfaceColor, addHalo, setHaloColor, removeHalo, and plenty more. We might want to wrap all or some of these in a single function to provide a more convenient API to the R user. Design for humans: always keep in mind the interface you make available to users as you develop the package. You can always go beyond what the underlying library provides. For instance, the country selected by default is always China, regardless of whether the data includes that country or not. This can lead to creating underwhelming visualisations as no arcs appear. One can consider adding to the gio function simple heuristics to ensure that is not the case, or have the function throw a warning when the initial country is not present in the dataset. Finally, consider R users’ expectations. There are many prominent visualisation packages on CRAN already, users of the gio package will likely have used ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2020), plotly, or highcharter before. Though these provide somewhat different APIs they set precedents, the more the API of gio resembles those the easier it will be for new users to start using gio. However, do not let this restrict the package either, never hesitate to do differently than ggplot2 if you think it will provide a better interface to your users. References "],["shiny-intro.html", "Chapter 11 Bidirectional Communication 11.1 Websocket &amp; Shiny 11.2 Alerts, an example", " Chapter 11 Bidirectional Communication Shiny is the web framework of choice for the R programming language. Since JavaScript and Shiny both run in web browsers it follows that they can run alongside one another as one can include JavaScript in such applications. Yet, often disregarded is the ability for Shiny’s R server to communicate to the front-end and vice versa. This collection of chapters aims to show precisely how this works. In this first part, we brush up on the essentials so we understand how to include JavaScript in shiny applications. Then again, the goal is not to write a lot of convoluted JavaScript, on the contrary, with little knowledge of the language the aim is to write as little as possible but demonstrate to the reader that it is often enough to greatly improve the user experience of shiny applications. 11.1 Websocket &amp; Shiny Shiny applications have two components the user interface (UI) and the server function. These two components communicate via a websocket: a persistent connection that allows passing messages between the server and clients connecting to it. In the R server this connection is managed by shiny using the httpuv (Cheng and Chang 2020) and websocket (Chang, Cheng, Dipert, et al. 2020) packages, while in clients connecting to the server this connection is managed with JavaScript. With that in mind we can put together a shiny applications which though simple exploits bi-directional communication. The application takes a text input, sends the value of the input to the R server which sends it back to the UI. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( textInput(&quot;nameInput&quot;, &quot;Your name&quot;), textOutput(&quot;nameOutput&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$nameOutput &lt;- renderText({ input$nameInput }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Drawing a diagram of the communication between the UI and the server reveals that thought this is a simple application a lot is happening. Communicating between the R server and the user interface requires JavaScript and thus makes a reasonable chunk of this part of the book on web development with shiny. 11.2 Alerts, an example Let’s exploit an external library to demonstrate how this works: jBox allows displaying “notices,” similar to vanilla JavaScript alerts, but much better looking and with additional functionalities. The grand scheme is to build an application that displays a notification at the click of an actionButton and “tells” the server when that notification is closed. Though the introduction of this book includes best practices on how to include dependencies and JavaScript files much of that will be disregarded in this section (and only in this section) so it does not get in the way of explaining bidirectional communication through the websocket in shiny. Moreover, the jBox library comes with numerous features to display tooltips, modals, notices, and more, which would make for too long a chapter; only notices shall be covered here. Let’s first take a look at the code that generates a jBox notice. 11.2.1 Explore Below we build an extremely basic example that features jBox in HTML, it includes the dependencies and a short script that displays a notification when the page is loaded. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; xml:lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Script to show a notification --&gt; &lt;script&gt; new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, { content: &#39;Hurray! A notice!&#39; }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; The very first thing one should do is to recreate this basic example in shiny so that when the app is loaded the notification appear, we will make this work with the bidirectional websocket communication afterwards. The “j” in jBox stands for jQuery which is already a dependency of shiny itself, there is therefore no need to import it, on the contrary one should not in order to avoid clashes. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( src = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js&quot; ) ), tags$link( rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;, href = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css&quot; ) ) ), tags$script(&quot; new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, { content: &#39;Hurray! A notice!&#39; });&quot; ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) {} shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 11.1: A basic jBox notice The application above essentially reproduces the basic HTML example that was shared; the dependencies are imported and a script displays a notification. Since all of that takes place in the front-end the body of the server function is empty. 11.2.2 From R to JavaScript Now that we have a simple notice displayed in the application we can tie it with the R server; the alert should display a message sent by the R server, this would enable more dynamic messages such as displaying a message taken from a database or a user input. As might be expected there are two functions required to do so, an R function and its JavaScript complementary: one to send the data from the server and another to catch said data in the client and display the notice. Let us start by writing the R code to send the data, thankfully very little is required of the developer. One can send data from the R server to the client from the session object using the sendCustomMessage method. Note that being a method of the session object implies that this message will only be sent to said session: only the client connected to that session will receive the message. The sendCustomMessage method takes two arguments, first an identifier (type), second the actual data to send to JavaScript (message). The identifier passed first will be necessary JavaScript-side to “catch” that message and show the notice. server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ # set the identifier to send-notice session$sendCustomMessage( type = &quot;send-notice&quot;, message = &quot;Hi there!&quot; ) } So while the above sends the message to JavaScript through the websocket nothing is yet to be done with that message once it arrives in the client. We can add a “handler” for the identifier we defined (send-notice) which will do something with the message we sent from the server. This is done with the addCustomMessageHandler method from the Shiny object where the first argument is the identifier and the second is the function that handles the message, a function that takes a single argument: the data sent from the server. Below we add the handler for messages of type send-notice, the handler itself is a function that accepts the messages that was sent from the server and uses it to generate the notice via jBox. tags$script( &quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-notice&#39;, function(message) { new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, { content: message }); });&quot; ) This effectively enables passing a message that is taken from a database for instance, or as shown below from a user input, to the front-end which generates a notice. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( src = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js&quot; ) ), tags$link( rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;, href = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css&quot; ) ) ), textInput(&quot;msg&quot;, &quot;notice&quot;), actionButton(&quot;notify&quot;, &quot;Notify myself&quot;), tags$script( &quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-notice&#39;, function(message) { new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, { content: message }); });&quot; ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { observeEvent(input$notify, { session$sendCustomMessage( type = &quot;send-notice&quot;, message = input$msg ) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 11.2: [A notice triggered by the server In the application above, notice the path that the message follows: it goes from the client (user input) to the server (observeEvent) which sends (sendCustomMessage) it back to the client. This might be considered suboptimal by some as it is not necessary to use the server as intermediary (in this example at least). Though there is some truth to this the above will work perfectly fine—and the aim here is to make JavaScript work with R—not alongside it, the websocket is very efficient and this will not have much overhead at all. 11.2.3 Serialisation Let’s delve deeper into the data that is sent from the server to the front-end to understand how we can further customise the notice displayed, e.g.: change the colour. new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, { content: &#39;Hurray! A notice!&#39;, color: &#39;red&#39; }); The jBox notice is configured using a JSON object containing the options that define said notice to display (example above), including but not limited to the message. The most straightforward way to make all those options accessible to the server is to construct that list of options server-side before sending it to the the front-end. For instance the JSON of options displayed above would look like the R list below. options &lt;- list( content = &#39;Hurray! A notice!&#39;, color = &#39;red&#39; ) jsonlite::toJSON(options, pretty = TRUE, auto_unbox = TRUE) #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hurray! A notice!&quot;, #&gt; &quot;color&quot;: &quot;red&quot; #&gt; } Therefore one could construct this list server-side and use it in jBox straight away, doing so means the JavaScript code can be simplified to new jBox('Notice', message);. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( src = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js&quot; ) ), tags$link( rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;, href = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css&quot; ) ), tags$script(&quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-notice&#39;, function(message) { // use notice send from the server new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, message); });&quot;) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ # define notice options notice = list( content = &#39;Hello from the server&#39;, color = &#39;black&#39; ) # send the notice session$sendCustomMessage(type = &quot;send-notice&quot;, message = notice) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 11.3: Customised jBox notice 11.2.4 JavaScript to R Thus far we have covered how to pass data from the R server to JavaScript in order to display a notification but we have yet to make the data travel the other way: from JavaScript to R. In this example we would like to send data from JavaScript to R when the notice is closed (either by itself or the user). One very common way that such feedback is enabled in JavaScript is through events and callback functions which are triggered upon an action being performed by the user (like the click of a button) or when other interesting things happen in the code. jBox provides numerous such events so functions can be used when a modal is created or when a notice is closed for instance. The concept of the callback function is not totally foreign to R albeit rarely used. For instance, shiny comes with this feature, shiny::onStop and shiny::onStart. These allow having functions run when the application starts or exits, very useful to clean up and close database connections when the app exits. server &lt;- function(input, output){ shiny::onStop( # callback function fired when app is closed function(){ cat(&quot;App has been closed&quot;) } ) } In jBox, these callback functions are included in the JSON of options, below the onClose event is fired when the notice is closed. { content: &#39;Alert!&#39;, onClose: function(){ // Fired when closed console.log(&#39;Alert is closed&#39;); } } This raises one issue, one cannot truly serialise to executable code. The attempt below serialises the function to a string that will not be evaluated in JavaScript, just like \"function(x){ x + 1 }\" is not evaluated in R: it’s not a function, it’s a string. # try to serialise an R function jsonlite::toJSON(&quot;function(x){x + 1}&quot;, auto_unbox = TRUE) #&gt; &quot;function(x){x + 1}&quot; One solution is to append the callback function to the object of options JavaScript-side. tags$script(&quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-alert&#39;, function(message) { // append callback message.onClose = function(){ // TODO send data back to R } new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, message); });&quot;) Placing a function inside a JSON object is common in JavaScript, in contrast with R where though it works is rarely if ever done (reference class/R6 are somewhat similar). The above JavaScript code to append the callback function could look something like the snippet below in R. message &lt;- list(content = &quot;hello&quot;) message$onClose &lt;- function(msg){ print(msg) } message$onClose(&quot;Closing!&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;Closing!&quot; This explains how the event is used in jBox (and many other libraries) but the body of the callback used previously is empty and therefore will not do anything: we need it to send data back to the R server so it can be notified when the notice is closed. This can be done by defining a simplified shiny input. While the book will eventually cover fully-fledged shiny inputs that can be registered, updated, and more, there is also a simplified version of the latter which allows sending reactive input values to the server where it can be used just like any other inputs (input$id). The value of the input can be defined using the setInputValue method which takes the id of the input and the value to give it. Below place Shiny.setInputValue('notice_close', true) in the body of the function so the input input$notice_close will be set to TRUE when the notice closes. tags$script(&quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-alert&#39;, function(message) { // append callback message.onClose = function(){ Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;notice_close&#39;, true); } new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, message); });&quot;) However Shiny internally optimises how those values are set. First, if the input is set to the same value then Shiny ignores it. This is fine if you are interested in the actual value of the input but will not work as expected if the input is to be used as event. Indeed if you want to use this input in an observe, observeEvent, or eventReactive, you want it to be triggered every time the input changes, regardless of whether that value is the same as before. The second optimisation Shiny does is when the input is set to multiple different values before these have been processed then only the most recent value will actually be sent to the server. One can opt-out of these optimisations using the priority: \"event\" option when setting the input value which is what we shall do here. We are not interested in the actual value of that input TRUE, we want to make sure the server gets notified every time a notification closes and given the optimisations it will not since. The first time the event will be fired the input will be set from NULL to TRUE but every subsequent notification that close will not fired that event since the value will not change (it’s always sending TRUE to the server). tags$script(&quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-alert&#39;, function(message) { // append callback message.onClose = function(){ Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;notice_close&#39;, true, {priority: &#39;event&#39;}); } new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, message); });&quot;) That done it can be incorporated into the application built thus far. Something interesting could be done server-side but to keep things brief and simple we merely print the value of the input to the R console. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( src = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js&quot; ) ), tags$link( rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;, href = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/&quot;, &quot;jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css&quot; ) ), tags$script( &quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-notice&#39;, function(message) { message.onClose = function(){ Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;notice_close&#39;, true, {priority: &#39;event&#39;}); } new jBox(&#39;Notice&#39;, message); });&quot; ) ), textInput(&quot;msg&quot;, &quot;A message to show as notice&quot;), actionButton(&quot;show&quot;, &quot;Show the notice&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ observeEvent(input$show, { # define notice options notice = list( content = input$msg, color = &#39;black&#39; ) # send the notice session$sendCustomMessage( type = &quot;send-notice&quot;, message = notice ) }) # print the output of the notice_close event (when fired) observeEvent(input$notice_close, { print(input$notice_close) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) #&gt; [1] TRUE FIGURE 11.4: jBox final application In the next chapter we will build another application that makes use of bidirectional communication but also introduces a few more concepts to improve how such communication takes place and allows passing more complex messages from R to JavaScript and vice versa.

However, the notices displayed in the previous chapter though demonstrates how both languages can work together within shiny, comes short of illustrating some more advanced use cases, how to package such code, and more. We shall introduce a rather fascinating JavaScript library that enables running machine learning models in web browsers: ml5.js. The library is a high level interface to tensorflow.js but nonetheless very extensive as it includes a multitude of models to deal with sound, image, text, and more. In this chapter one of those models is implemented, an image classifier using mobileNet but the method shown can be used to integrate any other model later on. This is not a gimmick, running a model this way means it runs in the client (web browsers), and not on the shiny server leaving it free to compute anything else and serve other concurrent users. It’s also fast, JavaScript is often wrongly believed to be slow, on the contrary. Finally, the JavaScript API provided is dead simple, it’s impressive how ml5.js exposes complex models through such a simple API. We start by exploring ml5.js, then plan the shiny application that will make use of it, and finally we wrap our work in the form of an R package. 12.1 Discover As for all projects that involve external libraries, the very first thing to do is to scan the documentation to understand how it is used. The documentation of ml5.js is exemplary, filled with examples and crystal clear, it gives the following example for the image classifier. // Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier(&#39;MobileNet&#39;, modelLoaded); // When the model is loaded function modelLoaded() { console.log(&#39;Model Loaded!&#39;); } // Make a prediction with a selected image classifier.classify(document.getElementById(&#39;image&#39;), (err, results) =&gt; { console.log(results); }); First, the image classifier is initialised from the ml5 object with the imageClassifier method. This method takes two arguments, the name of the pre-trained model to use (MobileNet) and a callback function that is run when the model is loaded. The the classify method from the classifier is used with, again, two arguments: 1) the DOM element that contains the image (&lt;img /&gt;) and a callback function to do something with the results of the classification. Now we can jump to the next section to think how this can be implemented in Shiny. 12.2 Setup In shiny, a dropdown menu could be provided to choose from pre-selected images and upon selection the server renders the selected image, at the click of a button the model then runs and sends the results to the R server which prints them in the UI. This makes for what is probably a signature of shiny: a huge amount of bi-directional communication between the server and client as shiny makes the most of the websocket. Some of the readers with more advanced knowledge in JavaScript will find ways to avoid the use of the server in places to do more in the client, either way works. 12.3 Dependencies The ml5.js framework and all its components are bundled in a single JavaScript file. &lt;script src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/ml5.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; We will create an html_dependency object using the htmlDependency function from the htmltools package. If confused, go back to the first part of the book on shiny prerequisites where it is explained in greater detail. We have two options at our disposal, either use the CDN (as shown in the previous code chunk), or download the file. We will start by making use of the CDN, later when we build a package for this functionality we shall download it to provide users of the package a choice between using the local file or the CDN. dependency_ml5 &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5&quot;, version = &quot;0.4.3&quot;, src = c(href = &quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/&quot;), script = &quot;ml5.min.js&quot; ) 12.4 Static files Images will of course be necessary in order to test the image classifier, we are therefore going to download some from wikipedia. The following code chunk creates a directory of assets, downloads images of birds and saves them to the aforementioned directory. For brevity we limit ourselves to downloading two images, one of a flamingo and another of a lorikeet but feel free to add more. Also note that the pre-trained image classifier we are going use in this example is not limited to birds. # static files directory dir.create(&quot;assets&quot;) # flamingo fl &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/&quot;, &quot;commons/thumb/7/72/American_flamingo&quot;, &quot;_%28Phoenicopterus_ruber%29.JPG/256px-&quot;, &quot;American_flamingo_%28Phoenicopterus_ruber%29.JPG&quot; ) # lorikeet lo &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/&quot;, &quot;commons/thumb/c/c2/Rainbow_lorikeet.jpg/&quot;, &quot;256px-Rainbow_lorikeet.jpg&quot; ) # download download.file(fl, destfile = &quot;assets/flamingo.jpg&quot;) download.file(lo, destfile = &quot;assets/lorikeet.jpg&quot;) Finally we should also add a JavaScript file which will eventually contain our custom functions to run the image classifier. file.create(&quot;www/classify.js&quot;) At this stage one should obtain a directory resembling the tree below. . ├── app.R └── assets ├── classify.js ├── flamingo.JPG └── lorikeet.jpg These files will eventually need to be served (addResourcePath) so they are accessible by the shiny UI. 12.5 Skeleton At this stage it’s probably good to build a skeleton of the application. After loading the shiny package we use the addResourcePath function to serve the images so they can be made accessible by the shiny UI to display. At this stage the application itself only provides a dropdown to select one of the two images previously downloaded, and a button to trigger the classification which currently does not do anything, we’ll delve into this next. Since we placed the classify.js JavaScript file in the assets directory we can also import it in the UI with a script tag, importantly this is done after the ml5.js dependency as it will depend on it. Another crucial thing that the app does is set the attribute id of the &lt;img&gt; to bird, it is important to have a convenient way to uniquely identify the image later on as ml5.js will need to read this image in order to classify it. library(shiny) # serve images addResourcePath(&quot;assets&quot;, &quot;assets&quot;) # ml5js dependency dependency_ml5 &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5&quot;, version = &quot;0.4.3&quot;, src = c(href = &quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/&quot;), script = &quot;ml5.min.js&quot; ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( dependency_ml5, tags$head( tags$script(src = &quot;assets/classify.js&quot;) ), selectInput( inputId = &quot;selectedBird&quot;, label = &quot;bird&quot;, choices = c(&quot;flamingo&quot;, &quot;lorikeet&quot;) ), actionButton(&quot;classify&quot;, &quot;Classify&quot;), uiOutput(&quot;birdDisplay&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$birdDisplay &lt;- renderUI({ path &lt;- sprintf(&quot;assets/%s.jpg&quot;, input$selectedBird) tags$img(src = path, id = &quot;bird&quot;) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 12.1: Shiny app skeleton 12.6 From R to JavaScript What is now left to do is to program the classification. As a reminder, when the “classify” button is clicked the classification must happen JavaScript-side using ml5.js, this implies that data must travel from R to JavaScript. This will be carried in a similar fashion as in the previous chapter on alerts; the R server needs to send a message to the front-end so it can trigger the classification using JavaScript. observeEvent(input$classify, { session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;classify&quot;, list()) }) We thus observe the button so that when clicked a message is sent to the front-end, via the websocket. Note that the sendCustomMessage method must take data, hence the empty list that is used as second argument. This of course won’t do anything as we are yet to add a handler in JavaScript to handle this classify message that is sent. Looking back at the documentation of ml5.js we observe that before we can classify the image the model should be loaded: we start by placing this code in the classify.js application. The classifier is initialised from the imageClassifier method which takes 1) the pre-trained model to use (or its name), 2) a callback function. The callback function is run when the model is done loading, though we don’t make use of it here the argument is not optional (omitting it will raise an error) so we pass a function that simply prints Model Loaded! to the console. // Mandatory callback function function modelLoaded() { console.log(&#39;Model Loaded!&#39;); } // Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier(&#39;MobileNet&#39;, modelLoaded); There is no need to repeatedly initialise the classifier every time a user hits the “classify” button: this should only be done once. Finally we can take care of the message hander. Remember the message sent from the R server bears the classify unique identifier. The handler function runs the classify method on the previously instantiated classifier object, this takes 1) the image to classify and 2) a callback function to handle the results of the classification. Here we truly get to why we gave the generated &lt;img&gt; of the selected bird and id: it helps us easily select that image from JavaScript to use in the classifier with document.getElementById(\"bird\"). // Mandatory callback function function modelLoaded() { console.log(&#39;Model Loaded!&#39;); } // Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier(&#39;MobileNet&#39;, modelLoaded); Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;classify&#39;, function(data){ // Classify bird classifier.classify(document.getElementById(&quot;bird&quot;), (err, results) =&gt; { console.log(results) }); }); As mentioned at the start of the chapter the results of the classification should be sent back to the R server but for now we shall content ourselves with logging it in the console. Running the application and opening the console already gives us encouraging results! The classifier gives “flamingo” the greatest confidence (albeit at 0.48). FIGURE 12.2: Results logged to the console 12.7 From JavaScript to R The application thus classifies the images but the results remain in the front-end and we would really like to have those results returned to the R server so we can further process them and display them back to the user. As in the previous chapter, this can be done with the setInputValue function which, as a reminder, will do exactly as advertised: it will set an input with a given value in the R server: the code below will make it such that the results will be accessible in the R server with input$classification. // Mandatory callback function function modelLoaded() { console.log(&#39;Model Loaded!&#39;); } // Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier(&#39;MobileNet&#39;, modelLoaded); Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;classify&#39;, function(data){ // Classify bird classifier.classify(document.getElementById(&quot;bird&quot;), (err, results) =&gt; { Shiny.setInputValue(&quot;classification&quot;, results) }); }); Now that the results are sent back to the R server we can use them to display it back in the application so users of the application may know how the model performed. We shall eventually make this prettier but for now we’ll limit it to displaying the results in verbatimTextOutput. library(shiny) # serve images addResourcePath(&quot;assets&quot;, &quot;assets&quot;) # ml5js dependency dependency_ml5 &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5&quot;, version = &quot;0.4.3&quot;, src = c(href = &quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/&quot;), script = &quot;ml5.min.js&quot; ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( dependency_ml5, tags$head(tags$script(src = &quot;assets/classify.js&quot;)), selectInput( inputId = &quot;selectedBird&quot;, label = &quot;bird&quot;, choices = c(&quot;flamingo&quot;, &quot;lorikeet&quot;) ), actionButton(&quot;classify&quot;, &quot;Classify&quot;), uiOutput(&quot;birdDisplay&quot;), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;results&quot;) # display results ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$birdDisplay &lt;- renderUI({ path &lt;- sprintf(&quot;assets/%s.jpg&quot;, input$selectedBird) tags$img(src = path, id = &quot;bird&quot;) }) observeEvent(input$classify, { session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;classify&quot;, list()) }) # render results output$results &lt;- renderPrint({ print(input$classification) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 12.3: Classifier basic output 12.8 Input handler In the previous section on sending data from R to JavaScript we used a “message handler” in JavaScript to handle the data coming from the server. There is also the corollary, an “input handler” to preprocess the data coming from JavaScript before it is made accessible by the input. In R, this is a function that must accept three arguments, the data coming JavaScript, a shiny session, and the name of the input. Note that all of these arguments are mandatory, if they are not used in the function one omit them and use the three dot construct instead. Input handlers are most often used to reshape or change the type of the data coming in. To demonstrate how use them, we will reshape the classification results sent to R as looking at the results of the classification in the R server one might notice a rowwise list which can be transformed into a data.frame. The function below makes use of the purrr (Henry and Wickham 2020) package to loop over every result and transform them into data.frames and return a single dataframe. # create handler process_results &lt;- function(data, ...){ purrr::map_dfr(data, as.data.frame) } Once this function created it needs to be registered with shiny using the registerInputHandler function which takes two arguments. First, a unique identifier for the handler, second, the handler function. Attempt to give the handler a unique yet simple name (alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods) to avoid clashes with other handlers. # register with shiny shiny::registerInputHandler(&quot;ml5.class&quot;, process_results) Note that handlers can only be registered once, running the above twice will fail the second time, even if the handler function has changed. This is to ensure one does not accidentally overwrite handlers brought in by other packages. These can be overwritten by explicitely setting force to TRUE but it is not advised. It is not advised to overwrite the registered handler. # register with shiny registerInputHandler(&quot;ml5.class&quot;, process_results) Once the handler function created and registered with shiny what is left to do is tell shiny which input should use that handler. This is done by adding the name of the handler, ml5.class, preceded by a colon (:ml5.class) as a suffix to the input name. Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;classify&#39;, function(data){ // Classify bird classifier.classify(document.getElementById(&quot;bird&quot;), (err, results) =&gt; { Shiny.setInputValue(&quot;classification:ml5.class&quot;, results); }); }); Now that the results of input$classification is a data.frame we can display the results in a neat table instead. library(shiny) # serve images addResourcePath(&quot;assets&quot;, &quot;assets&quot;) # create handler handler &lt;- function(data, ...){ purrr::map_dfr(data, as.data.frame) } # register with shiny shiny::registerInputHandler(&quot;ml5.class&quot;, handler) # ml5js dependency dependency_ml5 &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5&quot;, version = &quot;0.4.3&quot;, src = c(href = &quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/&quot;), script = &quot;ml5.min.js&quot; ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( dependency_ml5, tags$head(tags$script(src = &quot;assets/classify.js&quot;)), selectInput( inputId = &quot;selectedBird&quot;, label = &quot;bird&quot;, choices = c(&quot;flamingo&quot;, &quot;lorikeet&quot;) ), actionButton(&quot;classify&quot;, &quot;Classify&quot;), uiOutput(&quot;birdDisplay&quot;), tableOutput(&quot;results&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$birdDisplay &lt;- renderUI({ path &lt;- sprintf(&quot;assets/%s.jpg&quot;, input$selectedBird) tags$img(src = path, id = &quot;bird&quot;) }) observeEvent(input$classify, { session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;classify&quot;, list()) }) output$results &lt;- renderTable({ input$classification }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 12.4: Classifier table output 12.9 As a package This chapter thus far built a nice application but the code written is hardly portable; were one to make use of the image classifier from ml5.js in another application everything would have to be rewritten or copy pasted which hardly good practice and not remotely convenient, instead this code should be packaged so it is easily reusable and shareable. Moreover, this will benefit from all the other advantages that R packages bring to code such as documentation, reproducibility, and tests. This also forces the developer to think about the code differently, as we’ll discover it’s not as simple as wrapping individual functionalities from the app into functions. Before we delve into building the package let us think through what it should include. The application using ml5 gives some indication as to what the package will look like. Users of the package should be able to reproduce what is executed in the application, namely import dependencies (including the “message handler”), send data to the JavaScript front-end to trigger the classification, and then obtain the results in the R server. We start by creating a package called ml5. usethis::create_package(&quot;ml5&quot;) 12.9.1 Dependencies In the application the web hosted dependencies (CDN) were used. There are two advantages to using CDNs: 1) it’s just convenient as one does not have to download them, 2) it’s fast, CDNs are distributed geographically to improve the speed at which they serve the dependencies and will therefore generally outperform the alternative, serving the files locally. This may raise questions when building a package though as one generally want these to be as modular, self-contained, and reproducible as possible and none of these things go well with the idea of a remotely served dependency that is absolutely central to the package. The package should therefore provide both ways of importing dependencies: via the CDN or using locally stored files. The former will be faster while the latter can be used as fallback in the event there is an issue with the CDN or one does not have internet for instance. We can download the dependency hosted on the CDN and place it in the inst directory of the package. We also create another JavaScript classify.js that will contain the custom JavaScript code (message handler, etc) as was done for the application. # create directory dir.create(&quot;inst&quot;) # download dependency uri &lt;- &quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/ml5.min.js&quot; download.file(uri, destfile = &quot;inst/ml5.min.js&quot;) # create js file file.create(&quot;inst/classify.js&quot;) With the dependencies locally downloaded one can move on to create the R function that will be used to import the dependencies in the shiny UI. The file classify.js should be imported via this function too. The function useMl5 creates two html_dependency objects, one for the custom code with the message handler and another for the ml5 dependency, importantly at the end of the function these are returned in a tagList where order matters as these will be rendered in the order they are listed: first the ml5 dependency then the file containing our custom code. # R/deps.R #&#39; @export useMl5 &lt;- function(cdn = TRUE) { # internal classify.js file pkg &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5-pkg&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = &quot;&quot;, script = c(file = &quot;classify.js&quot;), package = &quot;ml5&quot; ) # ml5 dependency if(cdn) ml5 &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5&quot;, version = &quot;0.4.3&quot;, src = c(href = &quot;https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.4.3/dist/&quot;), script = &quot;ml5.min.js&quot; ) else ml5 &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;ml5&quot;, version = &quot;0.4.3&quot;, src = &quot;&quot;, script = c(file = &quot;ml5.min.js&quot;), package = &quot;ml5&quot; ) htmltools::tagList(ml5, pkg) } 12.9.2 Trigger classification There will be need for a function that sends a message to the front-end to trigger the classification. In the application built previously the id of the image to classify was hard-coded, this must be changed when building a package. First this will give users a much better interface where they may use whatever id suits them rather. Second, this will allow using the model to classify images that may be placed in different places and bear different ids. # R/classify.R #&#39; @export classify &lt;- function(id, session = shiny::getDefaultReactiveDomain()){ session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;ml5-classify&quot;, id) } 12.9.3 JavaScript code As a quick reminder, the JavaScript should initialise the model and provide a handler for the message ml5-classify that was defined in the previous section. Nothing needs to change with regard to the initialisation of the model. However there are two things to adapt in the message handler. First the id of the image to classify is now dynamically defined and passed from the R server, the code should therefore read document.getElementById(data) (where data is passed from the server) instead of document.getElementById('birds') as was previously hard-coded in the application. Second the application also had hardcoded the input id that was set with the results of the classification (input$classification) this will no longer work in a package: given the ability to classify multiple images the results of those classification should set different inputs so as not to overwrite one another. In the code below we therefore create a dynamic input using the id: id + _classification. Note that one can concatenate string in JavaScript using + while in R one would have to use the paste0 function. Examples: Classify image with id = 'birds' will return results to input$birds_classification Classify image with id = 'things' will return results to input$things_classification // Initialize the Image Classifier method with MobileNet const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier(&#39;MobileNet&#39;, modelLoaded); // When the model is loaded function modelLoaded() { console.log(&#39;Model Loaded!&#39;); } Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;ml5-classify&#39;, function(data){ // Make a prediction with a selected image classifier.classify(document.getElementById(data), (err, results) =&gt; { Shiny.setInputValue(data + &quot;_classification:ml5.class&quot;, results); }); }); 12.9.4 Input handler As mentioned previously the input handler that transforms the result sent from JavaScript to R into a data.frame can only be registered once. Therefore placing the code that was written in an R file in the package will not work, or rather will work only once. # R/handler.R handler &lt;- function(data, ...){ purrr::map_dfr(data, as.data.frame) } # This will error # register with shiny shiny::registerInputHandler(&quot;ml5.class&quot;, handler) When the library is loaded the first time it will work but all subsequent attempts will fails. library(ml5) #&gt; Loading ml5 library(ml5) #&gt; Loading ml5 #&gt; Error in shiny::registerInputHandler(&quot;ml5.class&quot;, handler) : #&gt; There is already an input handler for type: ml5.class Packages can run functions when they are loaded or attached an .onLoad function which is called when the library is loaded in the global environment. The difference between loading and attaching a package can be subtle, in this case it’s probably best to run the function when the package is loaded using .onLoad which the R Packages book describes as: Loading will load code, data and any DLLs; register S3 and S4 methods; and run the .onLoad() function. After loading, the package is available in memory, but because it’s not in the search path, you won’t be able to access its components without using ::. Confusingly, :: will also load a package automatically if it isn’t already loaded. It’s rare to load a package explicitly, but you can do so with requireNamespace() or loadNamespace(). — R Packages Book This could be used here to ensure the handler is only registered once; calling library(packageName) twice does not load the package twice, the second time it runs the function observes that the package is already loaded and thus does not load it again. The .onLoad replacement function may accept libname and pkgname arguments, we simplify the function to using ... as we do not need those arguments. # create handler handler &lt;- function(data, ...){ purrr::map_dfr(data, as.data.frame) } # register with shiny .onLoad &lt;- function(...){ shiny::registerInputHandler(&quot;ml5.class&quot;, handler) } 12.9.5 Test This is about all that is needed in order to build the package, one can then run devtools::document() to produce the man files and populate the namespace with the exported functions then install the package with devtools::install() in order to test it. library(DT) library(ml5) library(shiny) addResourcePath(&quot;assets&quot;, &quot;assets&quot;) ui &lt;- fluidPage( useMl5(), selectInput( inputId = &quot;selectedBird&quot;, label = &quot;bird&quot;, choices = c(&quot;flamingo&quot;, &quot;lorikeet&quot;) ), actionButton(&quot;classify&quot;, &quot;Classify&quot;), uiOutput(&quot;birdDisplay&quot;), DTOutput(&quot;results&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$birdDisplay &lt;- renderUI({ path &lt;- sprintf(&quot;assets/%s.jpg&quot;, input$selectedBird) tags$img(src = path, id = &quot;bird&quot;) }) observeEvent(input$classify, { classify(&quot;bird&quot;) }) output$results &lt;- renderDT({ datatable(input$bird_classification) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) References "],["shiny-tips.html", "Chapter 13 Tips &amp; Tricks 13.1 Shiny Events 13.2 Table Buttons 13.3 jQuery", " Chapter 13 Tips &amp; Tricks While previous chapters on working with Shiny made use of external libraries and built packages that brought new functionalities previously not available in shiny, one does not have to go to this length to take advantage of the learnings contained in those pages. Moreover there are a few interesting things that have not yet been explored. 13.1 Shiny Events There is a wee bit of documentation tucked away on the shiny website that contains a useful list of events that Shiny fires to notify the developer of interesting things that happen in the application. This includes events that are fired when outputs are being recalculated, when shiny connects, when an element become visible, and more. To demonstrate how to use those events and how handy they can be we will create a notification which appears to indicate that the server is busy running computations. This could be as fancy as ever but for simplicity’s sake we limit the demonstration to showing and hiding a gif. First, we create the directories and necessary files, and to indicate the server is busy we’ll be using a gif that is rather well-known in the R community. Note that we will be using some CSS, hence the style.css file. dir.create(&quot;www&quot;) file.create(&quot;www/script.js&quot;) file.create(&quot;www/style.css&quot;) # gif gif &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://github.com/JohnCoene/javascript-for-r/&quot;, &quot;raw/master/code/events/www/typing.gif&quot; ) download.file(gif, &quot;www/typing.gif&quot;) Then we create an application that draws and redraws a plot at the click of a button. Note that we give the gif an id as we will need to be able to retrieve this element JavaScript side (to dynamically show and hide it) and an id makes for an ideal selector. # app.R library(shiny) shiny::addResourcePath(&quot;www&quot;, &quot;www&quot;) ui &lt;- fluidPage( # import dependencies tags$head( tags$link(href = &quot;www/style.css&quot;, rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;), tags$script(src = &quot;www/script.js&quot;) ), # gif indicator tags$img(src = &quot;www/typing.gif&quot;, id = &quot;loading&quot;) plotOutput(&quot;plot&quot;), actionButton(&quot;render&quot;, &quot;render&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session) { output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({ input$render # redraw on click # simulate time consuming computations Sys.sleep(2) plot(cars) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) The gif should only be visible when the server is busy, unlike now. Whether it is visible will be controlled in JavaScript so this should be initialised as hidden using CSS. The code below hides the gif with visibility: hidden, and repositions it, floating on top of the rest of the content in the top right of the page, the z-index ensures the gif appears on top of other elements. /* style.css */ #loading{ top: 20px; right: 20px; height: 200px; z-index: 9999; position: absolute; visibility: hidden; } We can then use the shiny events to dynamically show and hide the gif when the server is busy. Below we observe the event shiny:busy on the entire page (document), when the event is triggered the gif is retrieved using its id and then made visible by changing its CSS visibility property to visible. // script.js $(document).on(&#39;shiny:busy&#39;, function(event) { // retrieve the gif var title = document.getElementById(&quot;loading&quot;); // make it visible title.style.visibility = &quot;visible&quot;; }); We then need to hide the gif when the server goes from busy to idle, using the shiny:idle event we can change the visibility of the gif back to hidden. // script.js $(document).on(&#39;shiny:busy&#39;, function(event) { // retrieve the gif var gif = document.getElementById(&quot;loading&quot;); // make gif visible gif.style.visibility = &quot;visible&quot;; }); $(document).on(&#39;shiny:idle&#39;, function(event) { var gif = document.getElementById(&quot;loading&quot;); // hide gif gif.style.visibility = &quot;hidden&quot;; }); The application will then display the gif when the server is busy running computations. FIGURE 13.1: Shiny with a busy indicator 13.2 Table Buttons For instance, using what was learned previously one can place buttons inside a shiny table and observe server-side which is clicked. Starting with a basic application that only includes a table to which we ultimately want to add a column containing a button on each row. Here we achieve this by having each button set a different value (e.g.: an id) to an input using shiny.setInputValue but one could very well create different input names for each button. library(DT) library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$table &lt;- renderDT({ datatable( mtcars, escape = FALSE, selection = &quot;none&quot;, rownames = FALSE, style = &quot;bootstrap&quot; ) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Note that in the above we pass some parameters to datatable not all are necessary at the exception of escape which is set to FALSE as we will ultimately place HTML code the table which should appear rendered rather than show said code as a string. We start by creating the on-click functions as R character strings for each row of the mtcars dataset. This is the function that will be triggered when buttons are clicked. This should look familiar, we use Shiny.setInputValue to define an input named click which is set to a different value for every row of the table. library(DT) library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$table &lt;- renderDT({ # on click function onclick &lt;- sprintf( &quot;Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;click&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, rownames(mtcars) ) datatable( mtcars, escape = FALSE, selection = &quot;none&quot;, rownames = FALSE, style = &quot;bootstrap&quot; ) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Next we create the buttons for each row and set the JavaScript functions previously created as the onClick attributes. The JavaScript code passed to the onClick attribute will be executed every time the button is clicked. library(DT) library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$table &lt;- renderDT({ # on click function onclick &lt;- sprintf( &quot;Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;click&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, rownames(mtcars) ) # button with onClick function button &lt;- sprintf( &quot;&lt;a class=&#39;btn btn-primary&#39; onClick=&#39;%s&#39;&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, onclick ) mtcars$button &lt;- button datatable( mtcars, escape = FALSE, selection = &quot;none&quot;, rownames = FALSE, style = &quot;bootstrap&quot; ) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) We can then observe the click input and, to demonstrate, render it’s value in the UI. library(DT) library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( br(), DTOutput(&quot;table&quot;), strong(&quot;Clicked Model:&quot;), verbatimTextOutput(&quot;model&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output) { output$table &lt;- renderDT({ # on click function onclick &lt;- sprintf( &quot;Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;click&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, rownames(mtcars) ) # button with onClick function button &lt;- sprintf( &quot;&lt;a class=&#39;btn btn-primary&#39; onClick=&#39;%s&#39;&gt;Click me&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, onclick ) # add button to data.frame mtcars$button &lt;- button datatable( mtcars, escape = FALSE, selection = &quot;none&quot;, rownames = FALSE, style = &quot;bootstrap&quot; ) }) output$model &lt;- renderPrint({ print(input$click) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 13.2: DT with custom inputs 13.3 jQuery The shiny framework itself makes use and thus imports the jQuery JavaScript library, a library that provides a convenient API to make a lot of things easier, including animations. As an example, we could use jQuery’s show, hide, or toggle functions to show or hide an HTML element at the press of a button. // example of jQuery animation $(&#39;#id&#39;).toggle(); Because jQuery is already imported there is no need to do so, on the contrary, importing it again will impact load time and might clash with the pre-existing version. Below we create a shiny application containing a message handler to toggle (show or hide element depending on its state) at the click of a button. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( &quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( &#39;jquery-toggle&#39;, function(id){ $(&#39;#&#39; + id).toggle(); // id });&quot; ) ), actionButton(&quot;toggle&quot;, &quot;Toggle text&quot;), h1(&quot;This text is shown!&quot;, id = &quot;text&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ observeEvent(input$toggle, { session$sendCustomMessage(&#39;jquery-toggle&#39;, &quot;text&quot;) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Note that jQuery takes a selector so one could very well use a class to hide and show multiple elements (with said class) at once. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( &quot;Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( &#39;jquery-toggle&#39;, function(selector){ $(selector).toggle(); });&quot; ) ), actionButton(&quot;toggle&quot;, &quot;Toggle text&quot;), h1(&quot;This text is shown!&quot;, class = &quot;to-toggle&quot;), actionButton(&quot;btn&quot;, &quot;Another visible button&quot;, class = &quot;to-toggle&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ observeEvent(input$toggle, { session$sendCustomMessage(&#39;jquery-toggle&#39;, &quot;.to-toggle&quot;) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) This is something where, again, R is leveraged in order to make it easier on the shiny developer but it must be said that it suffers from some inefficiency: the message travels from the browser (button click) to the R server where it is sent back to the browser and triggers toggle. It could indeed very well be rewritten in JavaScript entirely, this is however outside the scope of this book.

This will be demonstrated by creating something akin to the valueBox available in the shinydashboard (Chang and Borges Ribeiro 2018) package. While similar to what shinydashboard provides this box will 1) be fully customisable and 2) available in any shiny application 3) have additional functionalities. The valueBox equivalent we shall build in this chapter is named “boxxy,” and allows creating simple but colourful value boxes with animated numbers (by counting up to it) using countUp.js. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( boxxyOutput(&quot;countries&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$countries &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Countries&quot;, 95) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 14.1: Custom output example 14.1 Inner-workings At the core, this consists in creating three functions; boxxy, renderBoxxy and boxxyOutput (analogous to plot, renderPlot, plotOutput) which are linked by an “output binding” in JavaScript. The first function, boxxy will accept arguments that help define what is in the box. This function is generally useful to preprocess any of the arguments that are meant to produce the custom output. The boxxyOutput function essentially creates the scaffold of the HTML output (e.g.: &lt;div&gt;) as well as the dependencies. The render* function is perhaps more peculiar it should accept an expression and return a function. Previous work with shiny and JavaScript covered in this book had no dedicated “output” element that were placed in the shiny UI, therefore one had to use a function solely dedicated to importing the dependencies (e.g.: usejBox). However, since this is not the case here the dependencies can be attached together with the output. Finally, the two R functions are “bound” JavaScript-side with an “output binding” that renders the data from the render* function with its *output. 14.2 Setup The custom output will be part of a shiny application, let us thus create the basic skeleton of an application and download the dependencies. Create a project in RStudio or an empty directory, then: Create an app.R file that will hold the code for the application and boxxy, boxxyOutput, and renderBoxxy functions Create an assets directory that will contain the CSS and JavaScript files. Download the countUp.js dependency. Create a binding.js JavaScript file for the JavaScript binding within the previously created assets directory. Create a styles.css file in the assets directory. # application file file.create(&quot;app.R&quot;) # static file directory dir.create(&quot;assets&quot;) # countup dependency url &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/&quot;, &quot;countup@1.8.2/countUp.js&quot; ) download.file(url, &quot;assets/countup.js&quot;) # create binding file file.create(&quot;assets/binding.js&quot;) # CSS file file.create(&quot;assets/styles.css&quot;) This should produce the following directory structure. . ├── app.R └── assets ├── binding.js ├── countup.js └── styles.css 14.3 Output R Function The boxxy function takes three arguments, a title, a value that will be animated and the background color to use for the box. The function, at this stage at least, does not preprocess the arguments and simply returns them as a named list. # app.R library(shiny) boxxy &lt;- function(title, value, color = &quot;#ef476f&quot;){ list(title = title, value = value, color = color) } 14.4 Generate Output HTML The boxxyOutput function, like all such functions (plotOutput, uiOutput, etc.) takes an id. This function should return an HTML tag which bears an id, or a data-input-id attribute (more on that later) and a class. The id is to be defined by the user of the function in Shiny just like any other such outputs. For instance, plotOutput creates a &lt;div&gt; the id of which is actually the id used in the plotOutput function. # the id is used as id to the element shiny::plotOutput(id = &quot;myPlotId&quot;) &lt;div id=&quot;myPlotId&quot; class=&quot;shiny-plot-output&quot; style=&quot;width: 100% ; height: 400px&quot;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The class is used JavaScript-side to “find” the outputs in the DOM (document object model) and generate the output. The function boxxyOutput could thus be as shown below, the id is passed along to the &lt;div&gt; which is created with a boxxy class that will be used in the output binding to find that element and generate the output within that very &lt;div&gt; using data that will be passed from the server. boxxyOutput &lt;- function(id){ # the HTML output shiny::tags$div( id = id, class = &quot;boxxy&quot; ) } Make sure you use unique class names so they are not accidentally overridden by the user. As shown previously the box should include a title and an animated value. These could be generated entirely in JavaScript but it’s actually easier to create placeholders with htmltools tags, we generate dynamic ids for those so they can easily be referenced later on in JavaScript: id-boxxy-value for the value and id-boxxy-title for the title. boxxyOutput &lt;- function(id){ # the HTML output shiny::tags$div( id = id, class = &quot;boxxy&quot;, h1( id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-value&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-value&quot; ), p( id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-title&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-title&quot; ) ) } Finally, we also used classes in the output so every element it comprises can be styled with ease. .boxxy{ text-align: center; border-left: 6px solid #073b4c; padding: 1em; } .boxxy-title{ text-transform: uppercase; } .boxxy-value{ font-size: 3em; } The dependencies should be added to the above, since this function must be placed in the UI for anything to work the dependencies can piggyback on the output element. This works using the htmltools package. The function htmltools::htmlDependency is used to create a dependency that is then attached with htmltools::attachDependencies. While the former creates an object that shiny can understand and translate into &lt;script&gt; or &lt;style&gt; tags, the former attaches them to the output object and ensures dependencies are not imported multiple times (e.g.: when boxxyOutput is used more than once). Notice the use of normalizePath to retrieve the full path to the assets directory as this will not work with a relative path (e.g.: ./assets). The dependencies consist of the three files previously created and necessary to generate the output: countup.js the dependency that was downloaded as well as binding.js and styles.css. boxxyOutput &lt;- function(id){ el &lt;- tags$div( id = id, class = &quot;boxxy&quot;, h1( id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-counter&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-value&quot; ), p( id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-title&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-title&quot; ) ) # get full path path &lt;- normalizePath(&quot;assets&quot;) deps &lt;- list( htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;boxxy&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = c(&quot;countup.js&quot;, &quot;binding.js&quot;), stylesheet = &quot;styles.css&quot; ) ) htmltools::attachDependencies(el, deps) } Running the function reveals the HTML it generates at the exception of the dependencies which htmltools does not print to the console. boxxyOutput(&quot;myID&quot;) &lt;div id=&quot;myID&quot; class=&quot;boxxy&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;myID-boxxy-counter&quot; class=&quot;boxxy-value&quot;&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;myID-boxxy-title&quot; class=&quot;boxxy-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 14.5 Output Renderer The function renderBoxxy should accept an expression, like other such render* function. For instance in the example below the renderPlot function does accept an expression which uses, amongst other functions, plot. output$myPlot &lt;- renderPlot({ # this is an expression cars %&gt;% head() %&gt;% plot() }) The function renderBoxxy takes an expression and other arguments that are passed to shiny::exprToFunction this does pretty much what it says on the tin: it returns a function from an expression (unless that expression is a function, in which case it returns the expression). This function must be further wrapped in another as render functions must return functions. renderBoxxy &lt;- function(expr, env = parent.frame(), quoted = FALSE) { # Convert the expression + environment into a function func &lt;- shiny::exprToFunction(expr, env, quoted) function(){ func() } } 14.6 JavaScript Output Binding Here we create an “output binding,” it tells Shiny how to find the component and how to interact with it. An output binding is initialised from Shiny.OutputBinding. Below we initialise a new binding. // custom.js var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); Then, this must be “extended” by specifying a number of methods, a very necessary one being find. It is used to look for the output HTML element in the document (scope), and return them as an array (HTMLcollection). Other methods all take an el argument; that value will always be an element that was returned from find. A very straightforward way to accomplish this is to use jQuery’s find method to identify elements with the boxxy class used in boxxyOutput. You are by no means forced to use a CSS class to identify the elements but there is no reason not to. // custom.js var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); } }); One might then want to use the getId method which returns the id of the element, by default, as can be seen in the source code (below), the binding returns the id as the data-input-id attribute and if that is falsy it returns the element’s id. // getId default this.getId = function(el) { return el[&#39;data-input-id&#39;] || el.id; } Since boxxy uses the element id the default will work and this can be skipped entirely. Next, one needs to implement the renderValue function which is the very function that generates the output based on data used in boxxy and sent to the front-end with renderBoxxy. The renderValue method accepts two arguments, first el the element where the output should be generated, this is effectively the output of boxxyOutput which the binding found using find, the second argument is data which is the data passed to boxxy and serialised via renderBoxxy. The renderValue is in effect very similar if not identical to the JavaScript function of the same name involved in creating htmlwidgets. 14.6.1 Boxxy Title Let’s now tackle the first of the three core aspect of the boxxy output: the title. The title should be placed in the previously created placeholder which bears the id-boxxy-title; exactly as was done with htmlwidgets previously we insert title (data.title) in the element with innerText. The dynamically generated id for the title is built in the same way it is in R, by concatenating the id with -boxxy-title In R sprintf(\"%s-boxxy-title\", id) In JavaScript el.id + '-boxxy-title' var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); }, renderValue: function(el, data) { // insert the title let title_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-title&#39;; document.getElementById(title_id).innerText = data.title } }); 14.6.2 Boxxy Value Though the custom output could be limited to a static value generated in a fashion similar to how the title is placed, we opted for a more fancy animated value using countUp.js. Initialise a new counter, specifying the id of the element where it should be created, then as second argument the starting value from which the counter should start and finally the value to count up to. Note that there is a fourth argument to pass a JSON of options which we do not use here. // place counter in elementId // start at 0 and count up to 123 const counter = new CountUp(&#39;elementId&#39;, 0, 123); counter.start(); The counter has to be generated in the &lt;h1&gt; placeholder bearing the id-boxxy-value, while the value to count up to is stored in data.value meaning the counter can be initialised with new CountUp(el.id + '-boxxy-value', 0, data.value);. var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); }, renderValue: function(el, data) { // insert the title let title_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-title&#39;; document.getElementById(title_id).innerText = data.title // counter start at 0 let counter_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;; var counter = new CountUp(counter_id, 0, data.value); counter.start(); } }); 14.6.3 Boxxy Background Color Then we can set the background color that was passed to boxxy (data.color). var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); }, renderValue: function(el, data) { // insert the title let title_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-title&#39;; document.getElementById(title_id).innerText = data.title // counter start at 0 let counter_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;; var counter = new CountUp(counter_id, 0, data.value); counter.start(); // background color el.style.backgroundColor = data.color; } }); 14.6.4 Register the Output Binding Finally, the output binding must be registered with shiny. Note that it uses a unique string identifier, the documentation states: At the moment it is unused but future features may depend on it. var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); }, renderValue: function(el, data) { // insert the title let title_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-title&#39;; document.getElementById(title_id).innerText = data.title // counter start at 0 let counter_id = el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;; var counter = new CountUp(counter_id, 0, data.value); counter.start(); // background color el.style.backgroundColor = data.color; } }); // register Shiny.outputBindings.register(boxxyBinding, &quot;john.boxxy&quot;); Ensure that string uniquely identifies the binding to avoid future clash with other such bindings. 14.7 Boxxy Usage With all of this in place one can use boxxy in a shiny application. library(shiny) boxxy &lt;- function(title, value, color = &quot;black&quot;){ list(title = title, value = value, color = color) } boxxyOutput &lt;- function(id){ el &lt;- shiny::tags$div( id = id, class = &quot;boxxy&quot;, h1(id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-value&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-value&quot;), p(id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-title&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-title&quot;) ) path &lt;- normalizePath(&quot;assets&quot;) deps &lt;- list( htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;boxxy&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = c(&quot;countup.js&quot;, &quot;binding.js&quot;), stylesheet = &quot;styles.css&quot; ) ) htmltools::attachDependencies(el, deps) } renderBoxxy &lt;- function(expr, env = parent.frame(), quoted = FALSE) { # Convert the expression + environment into a function func &lt;- shiny::exprToFunction(expr, env, quoted) function(){ func() } } ui &lt;- fluidPage( h2(&quot;Custom outputs&quot;), fluidRow( column( 3, boxxyOutput(&quot;countries&quot;) ), column( 3, boxxyOutput(&quot;employees&quot;) ), column( 3, boxxyOutput(&quot;customers&quot;) ), column( 3, boxxyOutput(&quot;subs&quot;) ) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$countries &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Countries&quot;, 95, color = &quot;#ef476f&quot;) }) output$employees &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Thing&quot;, 650, color = &quot;#06d6a0&quot;) }) output$customers &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Customers&quot;, 13592, color = &quot;#118ab2&quot;) }) output$subs &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Subscriptions&quot;, 16719, color = &quot;#ffd166&quot;) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 14.2: Shiny application with boxxy 14.8 Injecting Dependencies We could consider making the animation of the value rendered with boxxy optional, some users may not want to use it. You might already imagine how a new argument and a few if statements could very easily do the job, but how would one handle the dependency? Surely if users do not want to make use of the animation the CountUp.js dependency should also be excluded so as to keep the output as light as possible. The dependency is currently attached in the boxxyOutput function which does not take any argument, it could but it would make for rather messy and confusing interface as whatever additional argument that indicates whether the numbers should be animated would have be specified twice, once in the boxxyOutput function so it does not import the dependency as well as in the boxxy function in order to serialise that parameter so the JavaScript binding does not run the animation function. # pseudo code # do not do this library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( boxxyOutput( &quot;countries&quot;, # do not import dependency animate = FALSE ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$countries &lt;- renderBoxxy({ # do not animate the numbers boxxy(&quot;Countries&quot;, 95, animate = FALSE) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Thankfully there is a better way, combining htmltools and shiny to insert the dependency dynamically from JavaScript. The boxxy function needs to take an additional argument animate which is passed to the output list. This will be used in the render function (and JavaScript binding) to dynamically render the dependency. boxxy &lt;- function(title, value, color = &quot;black&quot;, aniamte = TRUE){ list(title = title, value = value, color = color, animate = animate) } The boxxyOutput function can be slightly simplified, it currently attaches the countup.js dependency which needs to be removed. boxxyOutput &lt;- function(id){ el &lt;- shiny::tags$div( id = id, class = &quot;boxxy&quot;, h1(id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-value&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-value&quot;), p(id = sprintf(&quot;%s-boxxy-title&quot;, id), class = &quot;boxxy-title&quot;) ) path &lt;- normalizePath(&quot;assets&quot;) # only attach binding.js deps &lt;- list( htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;boxxy&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = c(&quot;binding.js&quot;), stylesheet = &quot;styles.css&quot; ) ) htmltools::attachDependencies(el, deps) } The renderBoxxy function sees quite some modifications, while before it was technically only returning a function that itself returned the output of boxxy (func() == boxxy()). Here we want to capture the output of boxxy to check whether the animate element is TRUE and if so add the dependency. renderBoxxy &lt;- function(expr, env = parent.frame(), quoted = FALSE) { # Convert the expression + environment into a function func &lt;- shiny::exprToFunction(expr, env, quoted) function(){ val &lt;- func() if(val$animate){ # add dependency } return(val) } } Within the if statement the dependency can be created with the htmltools as done for the binding. Ensure the names of the dependencies are unique as shiny internally uses it to differentiate between them, if they bear the same name shiny assumes they are the same and will only render one of them. Make sure dependencies bear different names or shiny thinks it’s the same and only renders one of them. The dependency generated with htmltools is then passed to the shiny::createWebDependency function which internally uses shiny::addResourcePath to serve the dependency. This is necessary here as, at this stage, the countup dependency is not actually rendered, below we merely add it to the list of options that serialised to JSON. Indeed this will actually be injected JavaScript-side, therefore the front-end needs to be able to access this file, hence it is served. renderBoxxy &lt;- function(expr, env = parent.frame(), quoted = FALSE) { # Convert the expression + environment into a function func &lt;- shiny::exprToFunction(expr, env, quoted) function(){ # evaluate to output list val &lt;- func() # add dependency if(val$animate){ path &lt;- normalizePath(&quot;assets&quot;) deps &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;countup&quot;, # change name version = &quot;1.8.2&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = c(&quot;countup.js&quot;) # only countup ) # serve dependency val$deps &lt;- list(shiny::createWebDependency(deps)) } return(val) } } Thus far the dependency is dynamically included in the R object that is serialised to JSON but it is not yet actually imported in the document, this happens in the JavaScript binding. The first thing we ought to do is mirror the if statement that was created in the renderBoxxy function, if the numbers should be animated the function can use countup, if not it must insert the text with insertText just like it does for the title. var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); }, renderValue: function(el, data) { el.style.backgroundColor = data.color; if(data.animate){ var counter = new CountUp(el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;, 0, data.value); counter.start(); } else { document.getElementById(el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;).innerText = data.value; } document.getElementById(el.id + &#39;-boxxy-title&#39;).innerText = data.title; } }); Shiny.outputBindings.register(boxxyBinding, &quot;john.boxxy&quot;); Finally, we can render the dependency, the JavaScript method aptly named renderDependencies will do just that from the list of dependency created in renderBoxxy. var boxxyBinding = new Shiny.OutputBinding(); $.extend(boxxyBinding, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.boxxy&quot;); }, renderValue: function(el, data) { el.style.backgroundColor = data.color; if(data.animate){ Shiny.renderDependencies(data.deps); // render dependency var counter = new CountUp(el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;, 0, data.value); counter.start(); } else { document.getElementById(el.id + &#39;-boxxy-value&#39;).innerText = data.value; } document.getElementById(el.id + &#39;-boxxy-title&#39;).innerText = data.title; } }); Shiny.outputBindings.register(boxxyBinding, &quot;john.boxxy&quot;); With those changes made not only is the animation of numbers optional but if users decide to turn off the animation in all boxxy functions the countup.js file will not be included at all. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( h2(&quot;Custom outputs&quot;), fluidRow( column( 3, boxxyOutput(&quot;countries&quot;) ), column( 3, boxxyOutput(&quot;employees&quot;) ) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$countries &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Countries&quot;, 176, animate = FALSE) }) output$employees &lt;- renderBoxxy({ boxxy(&quot;Thing&quot;, 67, animate = FALSE) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) 14.9 Preprocessing Custom Outputs One aspect that this example did not explore truly explore thus far is the idea that the function boxxy should preprocess the input more in order to be truly justify. Currently boxxy only wraps the arguments in a list, therefore the code below works too. # works too output$theId &lt;- renderBoxxy({ list(title = &quot;The Title&quot;, value = 123, color = &quot;blue&quot;, animate = TRUE) }) One the things boxxy could do is preprocess the input, below the function takes the sum of value to one pass a vector of any length and changes the default color argument to NULL so it is made dynamic based on the total value. boxxy &lt;- function(title, value, color = NULL, animate = TRUE){ # sum the vector value &lt;- sum(value) # dynamic color if(is.null(color)) if(value &gt; 100) color &lt;- &quot;#ef476f&quot; else color &lt;- &quot;#06d6a0&quot; list(title = title, value = value, color = color, animate = animate) } This means boxxy could be used like so: boxxy(\"Total\", c(1,6,9)).

Custom inputs are in fact no different than from shiny’s out-of-the-box inputs, they work in the exact same way and are built on the same system. To explain and demonstrate how to build such a custom input we shall build a switch input which is essentially a fancy-looking checkbox that can be toggled on and off. Custom shiny inputs very much resemble shiny outputs though they consist of a single R function (e.g.: selectInput) which generates the HTML and attaches necessary dependencies. In fact, when run from the R console such functions will reveal the HTML they generate. shiny::textInput(&quot;theId&quot;, &quot;The label&quot;) &lt;div class=&quot;form-group shiny-input-container&quot;&gt; &lt;label class=&quot;control-label&quot; for=&quot;theId&quot;&gt;The label&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&quot;theId&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The R function is paired with a JavaScript input binding akin to the output binding used in the previous chapter. 15.1 Setup Let’s set up the necessary files and project structure. Below an asset directory is created along with a JavaScript file where the binding will be placed as well as a CSS file that will style the switch input, an app.R file is also created to hold the R code and application. # create directory for application dir.create(&quot;switch/assets&quot;, recursive = TRUE) # create R, JS, and CSS files file.create(&quot;app.R&quot;) file.create(&quot;switch/assets/binding.js&quot;) file.create(&quot;switch/assets/styles.css&quot;) This should create the following directory structure. . ├── app.R └── assets ├── binding.js └── styles.css 15.2 Switch Input HTML &amp; Style We will use w3schools’ switch input template. The HTML of the input looks like so. &lt;label class=&quot;switch&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;slider&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/label&gt; While the CSS which stylises the checkbox input into a switch is the following. .switch { position: relative; display: inline-block; width: 60px; height: 34px; } .switch input { opacity: 0; width: 0; height: 0; } .slider { position: absolute; cursor: pointer; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-color: #ccc; -webkit-transition: .4s; transition: .4s; } .slider:before { position: absolute; content: &quot;&quot;; height: 26px; width: 26px; left: 4px; bottom: 4px; background-color: white; -webkit-transition: .4s; transition: .4s; } input:checked + .slider { background-color: #0462a1; } input:focus + .slider { box-shadow: 0 0 1px #0462a1; } input:checked + .slider:before { -webkit-transform: translateX(26px); -ms-transform: translateX(26px); transform: translateX(26px); } The above CSS should be placed in the previously created assets/styles.css file. FIGURE 15.1: Checkbox and styled switch input 15.3 Generate Input HTML Let us start with the R function to be used in the shiny UI. The &lt;input&gt; it generates bears a switchInput class which will be used to identify all switch inputs from JavaScript, this was also done in the custom output. The function accepts an id argument, this is also common across all inputs and outputs as a unique identifier is required in order to retrieve the input JavaScript-side. # app.R switchInput &lt;- function(id) { tags$input( id = id, type = &quot;checkbox&quot;, class = &quot;switchInput&quot; ) } The function should also accept a customary label and a checked argument to define the initial state of the switch. # app.R switchInput &lt;- function(id, label, checked = TRUE) { input &lt;- tags$input( id = id, type = &quot;checkbox&quot;, class = &quot;switchInput&quot; ) if(checked) input &lt;- htmltools::tagAppendAttributes(input, checked = NA) form &lt;- tagList( p(label), tags$label( class = &quot;switch&quot;, input, tags$span(class = &quot;slider&quot;) ) ) return(form) } As for the custom outputs, the dependencies (CSS and JavaScript binding) can piggy back on the generated HTML. # app.R switchInput &lt;- function(id, label, checked = TRUE) { input &lt;- tags$input( id = id, type = &quot;checkbox&quot;, class = &quot;switchInput&quot; ) if(checked) input &lt;- htmltools::tagAppendAttributes(input, checked = NA) form &lt;- tagList( p(label), tags$label( class = &quot;switch&quot;, input, tags$span(class = &quot;slider&quot;) ) ) path &lt;- normalizePath(&quot;./assets&quot;) deps &lt;- htmltools::htmlDependency( name = &quot;switchInput&quot;, version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;, src = c(file = path), script = &quot;binding.js&quot;, stylesheet = &quot;styles.css&quot; ) htmltools::attachDependencies(form, deps) } 15.4 JavaScript Input Binding The JavaScript input binding is instantiated from Shiny.InputBinding, this is similar to output bindings which are instantiated from Shiny.OutputBinding. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); Then again the binding is “extended,” this consists of adding several methods. find returns all the relevant inputs. getId returns the unique identifier of the input. getValue returns the value of the input to be sent to the server. setValue used to set the value of the input. receiveMessage used to receive messages from the server. subscribe tells shiny when and how to send the updated input value to the server. unsubscribe removes event handlers, stops shiny from sending updated values to the server. 15.4.1 Find Inputs The find method looks for all the relevant HTML elements in the document (scope), and returns them as an array. Many other method we are about to implement will accept el as an argument, this will ultimately be one of the elements returned by find. Generally the find method is used in conjunction with a class, hence the &lt;input&gt; generated by switchInput bears a class of the same name switchInput. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { // find inputs find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); } }); 15.4.2 Get Input Id The getId method is exactly it seems to be, it returns the id of the element. It looks for that id as data-input-id attribute and if that is not found returns the id; this can be observed in the source code (below). this.getId = function(el) { return el[&#39;data-input-id&#39;] || el.id; }; Since the default works there is no need to use it for the switch input. 15.4.3 Get Input Value This retrieves the value of the input, this is often the attribute of the same name (value=\"something\") which can be obtain with the jQuery val() method. The switch is an input of type checkbox and therefore uses the checked prop. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, // retrieve value getValue: function(el) { return $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;); } }); The value the checked prop is boolean, true if checked and false if unchecked. Ensure the getValue method actually returns the value. 15.4.4 Set Input Value The setValue method sets the value of the input, hence it also accepts the value object: the actual value to which the input should be set. Then again, most inputs will likely use the value attribute which can be set in jQuery with val(newValue) but the checkbox uses the checked prop. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, getValue: function(el) { return $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;); }, // check or uncheck the switch setValue: function(el, value) { $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;, value).change(); } Note the use of the change method which ensures the event is fired, otherwise the input is checked or unchecked but the change event is not fired and this will cause problems later on as we rely on this event. 15.4.5 Receive Input Messages The setValue method previously defined is only really useful when combined with receiveMessage, the latter handles messages sent to the input, these are generally sent from the server via functions the likes of updateSelectInput. Internally it uses the setValue method to define the value of the input received from the server. Note that the value is therefore a serialised JSON input coming from the R server and can be of any complexity you desire. Below we use it such that expect a simple boolean as the checkbox (switch) can be either on (true) or off (false). var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, getValue: function(el) { return $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;); }, setValue: function(el, value) { $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;, value).change(); }, // handle messages from the server receiveMessage: function(el, value){ this.setValue(el, value); } }); 15.4.6 Subscribe &amp; Unsubscribe Inputs Finally, a crucial method is subscribe, this is ran when the input is registered (more on that later) and is used to determine when shiny sends new values of the input back to the server. This method also accepts a callback which is the very function that tells shiny to update the value. This callback function accepts a single boolean value which in the source code states is used to enable debouncing or throttling. This is covered in the next section on rate policy. This method often consists of an event listener that observes changes on the input to send its to the server. In layman terms, when the switch input changes (on to off or vice versa) run the callback function which sends the data to the server. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, getValue: function(el) { return $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;); }, setValue: function(el, value) { $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;, value).change(); }, receiveMessage: function(el, value){ this.setValue(el, value); }, subscribe: function (el, callback) { $(el).on(&quot;change.switchInput&quot;, function(){ callback(true); }) }, unsubscribe: function(el) { $(el).off(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); } }); Note that in the subscribe method we listen for changes on the input, hence the setValue also uses jQuery’s change method; it ensures this event is fired and that shiny will subsequently pick it up. Make sure the setValue method triggers the event observed in subscribe 15.4.7 Input Rate Policy The rate policy determines how frequently the binding should send new input values back to the server. The getRatePolicy method should return an object that describes that, it is a JSON array with two variable policy and delay. direct The direct policy tells shiny to sends any new value directly, however often this occurs. Therefore, this policy does not make use of delay. { policy: &quot;direct&quot; } debounce The debounce policy tells shiny to ignore all new values until no new values have been received for delay milliseconds. { policy: &quot;debounce&quot;, delay: 2500 } throttle The throttle policy means that no more than one value will be sent per delay milliseconds. { policy: &quot;throttle&quot;, delay: 1000 } A switch input is not expected to change frequently but it’s nonetheless good practice to throttle it to ensure the server does not receive too many requests. This will admittedly be more relevant to inputs that see a higher rates of change like text fields which unless debounced send every key stroke to the server. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, getValue: function(el) { return $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;); }, setValue: function(el, value) { $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;, value).change(); }, receiveMessage: function(el, value){ this.setValue(el, value); }, subscribe: function (el, callback) { $(el).on(&quot;change.switchInput&quot;, function(){ callback(true); }) }, unsubscribe: function(el) { $(el).off(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, // throttle getRatePolicy: function(){ return { policy: &#39;throttle&#39;, delay: 1000 } } }); 15.4.8 Registering the Input Binding Finally, like the custom output, the input can be registered with shiny, it too takes a unique identifier as second argument. var switchInput = new Shiny.InputBinding(); $.extend(switchInput, { find: function(scope) { return $(scope).find(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, getValue: function(el) { return $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;); }, setValue: function(el, value) { $(el).prop(&quot;checked&quot;, value).change(); }, receiveMessage: function(el, value){ this.setValue(el, value); }, subscribe: function (el, callback) { $(el).on(&quot;change.switchInput&quot;, function(){ callback(true); }) }, unsubscribe: function(el) { $(el).off(&quot;.switchInput&quot;); }, getRatePolicy: function(){ return { policy: &#39;throttle&#39;, delay: 1000 } } }); Shiny.inputBindings.register(switchInput, &#39;john.switch&#39;); This wraps up a custom input, it can now be used in a shiny application library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( switchInput(&quot;switch&quot;, &quot;Show plot&quot;, FALSE), plotOutput(&quot;plot&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({ print(input$switch) if(!input$switch) return() plot(cars) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 15.2: Switch input example 15.5 Update Input The JavaScript binding was provided with the required methods to receive updates from the server to change the value of the switch input but the R function that sends those updates is yet to be written. update_switch_input &lt;- function(id, value, session = shiny::getDefaultReactiveDomain()){ session$sendInputMessage(id, value) } This pattern was used previously albeit using sendCustomMessage, with sendInputMessage the message can be sent straight to the receiveMessage handler of the input using 1) the id of the input and 2) the data one wants to send. We can adapt the application to make use of this button. library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( actionButton(&quot;chg&quot;, &quot;Switch ON&quot;), switchInput(&quot;switch&quot;, &quot;Switch input&quot;, FALSE), plotOutput(&quot;plot&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({ print(input$switch) if(!input$switch) return() plot(cars) }) observeEvent(input$chg, { update_switch_input(&quot;switch&quot;, TRUE, session) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) The diagram below attempts to summarize the various elements that were put together and used in the last application. It all starts from the switchInput function which generates the HTML defining the switch input and its initial state. In the subscribe method, an event listener checks for changes on this HTML element ($(el).on('change', ...)), every time it changes (check/uncheck) it fires the shiny callback which sends the value of the input obtained from getValue through the websocket. When the value of the input is changed from the server this value travels through the websocket to the front-end where receiveMessage uses setValue to programmatically change the check box which incidentally triggers the change event and back we go. 15.6 Exercise Add a toggle_switch_input that toggles between states so it turns it off when it’s on and vice versa Bring support for Bootstrap 3 text input addon "],["shiny-cookies.html", "Chapter 16 Cookies 16.1 Discover js-cookie 16.2 Setup Project 16.3 JavaScript Cookies 16.4 R Code", " Chapter 16 Cookies In this chapter we scout yet another great example of how JavaScript can enhance shiny applications. We use an HTTP cookie, a small piece of data sent from a application and stored in the user’s web browser, to track users returning to a shiny application. The application will prompt users to input their name, this will be stored in a cookie so that on their next visit they are welcomed to the app with a personalised message. Cookies are natively supported by web browsers and JavaScript, though we will use a library which greatly eases their handling: js-cookie. 16.1 Discover js-cookie The library is at its core very straightforward, it exports a Cookie object from which one can access the set, get, and remove methods. // set a cookie Cookies.set(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;value&#39;) // get cookies Cookies.get(); // remove a cookie Cookies.remove(&#39;name&#39;); There is also the possibility to pass additional options when defining the cookie, such as how long it is valid for, but we won’t explore these here. 16.2 Setup Project Then again, it starts with the creation of a directory where we’ll place a JavaScript file containing the message handlers, we won’t download the dependency and use the CDN instead but feel free to do differently. dir.create(&quot;www&quot;) file.create(&quot;www/script.js&quot;) We then lay down the skeleton of the application which features a text input to capture the name of the user, a button to save the cookie in their browsers, another to remove it and finally a dynamic output that will display the personalised message. library(shiny) addResourcePath(&quot;www&quot;, &quot;www&quot;) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( src = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-cookie@rc/&quot;, &quot;dist/js.cookie.min.js&quot; ) ), tags$script(src = &quot;www/script.js&quot;) ), textInput(&quot;name_set&quot;, &quot;What is your name?&quot;), actionButton(&quot;save&quot;, &quot;Save cookie&quot;), actionButton(&quot;remove&quot;, &quot;remove cookie&quot;), uiOutput(&quot;name_get&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ } shinyApp(ui, server) 16.3 JavaScript Cookies First we define a JavaScript function that retrieves the cookies and sets the result as an input named cookies. The reason we do so is simply because we will have to execute this in multiple places, this will become clearer in just a second. // script.js function getCookies(){ var res = Cookies.get(); Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;cookies&#39;, res); } Then we define two message handlers, one that sets the cookie and another that removes it. Note that both of them run the getCookies function defined previously after they are done with their respective operations. The reason this is done is that we need the input to be updated with the new values after it is set and after it is removed. Otherwise setting or removing the cookie will leave the actual input value untouched and the result of the operation (setting or removing the cookie) will not be captured server-side. // script.js Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;cookie-set&#39;, function(msg){ Cookies.set(msg.name, msg.value); getCookies(); }) Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(&#39;cookie-remove&#39;, function(msg){ Cookies.remove(msg.name); getCookies(); }) One more thing needs to be implemented JavaScript-side. The point of using the cookie is that when users comes back to the shiny app, even days later, they are presented with the personalised welcome message, this implies that when they open the application the input value is defined. Therefore, getCookies must at launch. One could be tempted to place it at the top of the JavaScript file so that it runs when it is imported but the issue there is that it will run too soon, it will run the shiny input is not yet available and fail to set it. Consequently, we instead observe the shiny:connected event, which is fired when the initial connection to the server is established. // script.js $(document).on(&#39;shiny:connected&#39;, function(ev){ getCookies(); }) 16.4 R Code Then it’s a matter a completing the shiny server which was left empty. We add an observeEvent on the save button where we check that a name has actually been typed in the text box before saving the cookie. There is another similar observer on the remove button. The renderUI expression checks that the cookie has been set and displays a message accordingly. library(shiny) addResourcePath(&quot;www&quot;, &quot;www&quot;) ui &lt;- fluidPage( tags$head( tags$script( src = paste0( &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-cookie@rc/&quot;, &quot;dist/js.cookie.min.js&quot; ) ), tags$script(src = &quot;www/script.js&quot;) ), textInput(&quot;name_set&quot;, &quot;What is your name?&quot;), actionButton(&quot;save&quot;, &quot;Save cookie&quot;), actionButton(&quot;remove&quot;, &quot;remove cookie&quot;), uiOutput(&quot;name_get&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output, session){ # save observeEvent(input$save, { msg &lt;- list( name = &quot;name&quot;, value = input$name_set ) if(input$name_set != &quot;&quot;) session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;cookie-set&quot;, msg) }) # delete observeEvent(input$remove, { msg &lt;- list(name = &quot;name&quot;) session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;cookie-remove&quot;, msg) }) # output if cookie is specified output$name_get &lt;- renderUI({ if(!is.null(input$cookies$name)) h3(&quot;Hello,&quot;, input$cookies$name) else h3(&quot;Who are you?&quot;) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 16.1: Shiny using cookies Run the application and save your name. You can then refresh the application and the welcome message will display your name. You can even kill the server entirely and re-run the app, the welcome message will still display!

This chapter explores how to apply that to htmlwidgets so they can provide additional functionalities when used in Shiny applications. To demonstrate how to integrate these functionalities in widgets we shall implement them in the previously built gio package. 17.1 Widgets to R In a previous chapter on Linking Widgets the topic of callback function was briefly explored. Gio.js provides a callback function that is fired every time a country is selected on globe, this is currently used to share said country with other widgets as part of the implementation with crosstalk. This callback function could also send data back to the R server where they could be used for many things like fetching more data on the selected country from a database, or use that information to generate a shiny UI element like displaying the flag of the selected country, and much, much more. The callback function in the gio package currently looks like this, it only makes use of some of the data for crosstalk. // define callback function function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); } // use callback function controller.onCountryPicked(callback); We can make further use of this to define two different shiny inputs; one for the selected country and another for its related edges. // gio.js // define callback function function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;selected&#39;, selectedCountry); Shiny.setInputValue(&#39;related&#39;, relatedCountries); } However, this will generate an issue experienced in a previous chapter; multiple gio visualisations in a single shiny application would be defining the values of a single input. This can be remedied to by using the id of the visualisation to dynamically generate the input name. renderValue: function(x) { var controller = new GIO.Controller(el); controller.addData(x.data); controller.setStyle(x.style); // callback function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); Shiny.setInputValue(el.id + &#39;_selected&#39;, selectedCountry); Shiny.setInputValue(el.id + &#39;_related&#39;, relatedCountries); } controller.onCountryPicked(callback); // render controller.init(); } The package can then be installed with devtools::install so we can test these inputs in a shiny application. library(gio) library(shiny) # large sample data url &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCoene/&quot;, &quot;javascript-for-r/master/data/countries.json&quot; ) arcs &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(url) ui &lt;- fluidPage( gioOutput(&quot;globe&quot;), fluidRow( column(6, verbatimTextOutput(&quot;selectedCountry&quot;)), column(6, verbatimTextOutput(&quot;relatedCountries&quot;)) ) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$globe &lt;- renderGio({ gio(arcs, source = i, target = e, value = v) }) output$selectedCountry &lt;- renderPrint({ print(input$globe_selected) }) output$relatedCountries &lt;- renderPrint({ print(input$globe_related) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 17.1: Gio with input data One thing to note before moving on, the data is sent from the client to the server whether the inputs are used or not, though this likely will not negatively impact gio it can reduce performances if the callback function is triggered too frequently. For instance an input value set when the user hovers a scatter plot might lead to the event being fired very frequently and too much data being sent to the server, slowing things down and providing a poor experience. Therefore one might consider making the capture of such event optional so the web browser is not strained unless explicitly asked by the developer of the application. This could be implemented with a simple function that sets a simple logical variable in the x object that is used in JavaScript to check whether to implement the callback function. #&#39; @export gio_capture_events &lt;- function(g) { g$x$capture_events &lt;- TRUE return(g) } Then this could be used in JavaScript with an if statement. if(x.capture_events) controller.onCountryPicked(callback); One might also consider not sending back all the data. For instance, gio returns the coordinates of the selected country where from arcs connect; this is might be considered unnecessary. The code below only sets the input to the ISO code of the country selected. function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { Shiny.setInputValue( el.id + &#39;_selected&#39;, selectedCountry.ISOCode ); } 17.2 Input Handlers for Widgets While input handlers were explored previously we found limited use for them as these were set to simple boolean values for which a preprocessor made little sense. It can be useful in this case as the inputs return more substantial data. Namely the input returning data on the related countries, it is converted from JSON to a list but could be reshaped to a data frame of arcs (looking like gio’s input data). Below we create a handler that is going to loop over the list (over each arc) and return a data frame. # handler.R related_countries_handler &lt;- function(x, session, inputname){ purrr::map_dfr(x, as.data.frame) } Then the handler must be registered with shiny, since handlers can only be registered once a good place to put it this is in the .onLoad function of the package. # zzz.R related_countries_handler &lt;- function(x, session, inputname){ purrr::map_dfr(x, as.data.frame) } .onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname) { shiny::registerInputHandler( &quot;gio.related.countries&quot;, related_countries_handler ) } Finally, we can reinstall the package with devtools::install and create shiny application to observe the change. Below we use a large example dataset and, since the input now returns a data frame, we can display the input value in a table. library(DT) library(gio) library(shiny) # large sample data url &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnCoene/&quot;, &quot;javascript-for-r/master/data/countries.json&quot; ) arcs &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(url) ui &lt;- fluidPage( gioOutput(&quot;globe&quot;), DTOutput(&quot;relatedCountries&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$globe &lt;- renderGio({ gio(arcs, i, e, v) }) output$relatedCountries &lt;- renderDT({ datatable(input$globe_related) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 17.2: Gio input data transformed to a data frame 17.3 R to Widgets This book previously explored how to send data from the shiny server to the front-end, this section applies this to htmlwidgets. Currently, using gio in shiny consists of generating the globe with the renderGio and complimentary gioOutput functions. This generates the entire visualisation, it creates the HTML element where it places the globe, draws the arcs based on the data, sets the style, etc. Now imagine that only one of those aspects needs changing, say the data, or the style, given the functions currently at hand one would have to redraw the entire visualisation, only this time changing the data or the style. This is inelegant and not efficient, most JavaScript visualisation libraries, including gio.js, will enable changing only certain aspects of the output without having to redraw it all from scratch. Before we look into the implementation, let us create a shiny application which would benefit from such a feature. The shiny application below provides a drop-down menu to select between two datasets to draw on the globe, running it reveals an issue with gio though. Upon selecting a dataset with the drop down a second globe appears underneath the original one. This is because internally gio.js creates a new element (&lt;canvas&gt;) within the &lt;div&gt; created by htmlwidgets when running init regardless of whether one was already created. Therefore, every call to init creates a new &lt;canvas&gt; with a different globe. Note that most visualisation libraries will not have that issue, they will detect the existing output and override it instead. library(gio) library(shiny) arcs1 &lt;- data.frame( e = c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;), i = c(&quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;US&quot;), v = c(100, 120, 130) ) arcs2 &lt;- data.frame( e = c(&quot;CN&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;JP&quot;), i = c(&quot;IN&quot;, &quot;JP&quot;, &quot;US&quot;), v = c(100, 120, 130) ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( selectInput( &quot;dataset&quot;, &quot;Select a dataset&quot;, choices = c(&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;) ), gioOutput(&quot;globe&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ reactive_arcs &lt;- reactive({ if(input$dataset == &quot;First&quot;) return(arcs1) return(arcs2) }) output$globe &lt;- renderGio({ gio(reactive_arcs(), i, e, v) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 17.3: Gio issue in shiny A solution to this is to ensure the container (el) is empty before generating the visualisation. Incidentally this can be executed with a JavaScript method previously used in this book: innerHTML. // gio.js el.innerHTML = &#39;&#39;; // empty el controller = new GIO.Controller(el); Now, using the dropdown to switch between dataset does not generate a new visualisation. We got sidetracked but this had to be fixed. Ideally, when the user selects a dataset from the dropdown the entire visualisation is not redrawn, only the underlying data (the arcs) changes. To do so, a new set of functions divorced from the ones currently at hand needs to be created. This separation will allow leaving the already created functions as-is, using gio and its corresponding renderValue JavaScript function to initialise a visualisation, and have a separate family of functions dedicated to working with different JavaScript functions which circumvent renderValue and directly change aspects of the visualisation, such as the underlying dataset. This involves a few moving parts, thankfully some of them were already explored, just not in the context of htmlwidgets. The scheme is to send data from R to JavaScript using the formerly exploited session$sendCustomMessage, then in JavaScript fetch the instance of the visualisation (controller in the case of gio) to interact with it (e.g.: controller.addData(data);). 17.3.1 Send Data from Widgets Let’s start by creating the R function used to send data to JavaScript. This is hopefully reminiscent of a previous chapter, this function sends a message to JavaScript where it is paired with “message handler” that does something with said message. Note that for consistency the function uses the same arguments as the other function of the package which accepts data: gio. #&#39; @export gio_send_data &lt;- function(id, data, source, target, value, session = shiny::getDefaultReactiveDomain()){ data &lt;- dplyr::select( data, i = {{ source }}, e = {{ target }}, v = {{ value }} ) message &lt;- list(id = id, data = data) session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;send-data&quot;, message) } The function takes the id of the visualisation the data is destined for, the data object itself, and a shiny session used to send the data. The id of the visualisation is sent as part of the message and will be used to retrieve the instance of the visualisation and subsequently apply the new dataset. Note that we give this message the send-data identifier, this will be needed when we write its handler. There is one caveat that will make it such that the above will not work. To have gio.js work with data changes had to be made to the serialiser (using the TOJSON_ARGS attribute), this cannot be used here. The data being sent with Shiny via the session object the problem reoccurs: shiny, like htmlwidgets, serialises data frames column-wise and not row-wise. One can preview the way shiny serialises with shiny:::toJSON (three-colon). # preview shiny serialisation shiny:::toJSON(arcs) #&gt; {&quot;e&quot;:[&quot;CN&quot;,&quot;CN&quot;],&quot;i&quot;:[&quot;US&quot;,&quot;RU&quot;],&quot;v&quot;:[3300000,10000]} Unfortunately this serialiser cannot be changed, therefore we have to reformat the data to a list which resembles the JSON output desired, using apply to turn every row into a list will do the job in most cases. #&#39; @export gio_send_data &lt;- function(id, data, source, target, value, session = shiny::getDefaultReactiveDomain()){ data &lt;- dplyr::select( data, i = {{ source }}, e = {{ target }}, v = {{ value }} ) message &lt;- list(id = id, data = apply(data, 1, as.list)) session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;send-data&quot;, message) } 17.3.2 Retrieve Widget Instance We will need to be able to access the instance of the visualisation (controller) outside of the function factory. This can be made accessible by adding a function (technically a method) that returns the controller. Below we create a function called getGlobe which returns the controller. HTMLWidgets.widget({ name: &#39;gio&#39;, type: &#39;output&#39;, factory: function(el, width, height) { // TODO: define shared variables for this instance var controller; // selection handle var sel_handle = new crosstalk.SelectionHandle(); sel_handle.on(&quot;change&quot;, function(e) { if (e.sender !== sel_handle) { // clear selection } controller.switchCountry(e.value[0]); }); return { renderValue: function(x) { el.innerHTML = &#39;&#39;; controller = new GIO.Controller(el, x.configs); // group sel_handle.setGroup(x.crosstalk.group); // add data controller.addData(x.data); controller.setStyle(x.style); // callback controller.onCountryPicked(callback); function callback (selectedCountry, relatedCountries) { sel_handle.set([selectedCountry.ISOCode]); Shiny.setInputValue( el.id + &#39;_selected&#39;, selectedCountry ); Shiny.setInputValue( el.id + &#39;_related:gio.related.countries&#39;, relatedCountries ); } // use stats if(x.stats) controller.enableStats(); // render controller.init(); }, resize: function(width, height) { // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size controller.resizeUpdate() }, getGlobe: function(){ return controller; } }; } }); Then, anywhere in the gio.js file, we create a function which uses HTMLWidgets.find to retrieve the instance of the htmlwidgets, it takes a selector as input. We concatenate the pound sign to select the widget based its id (#id, .class). This in effect returns an object which includes all the functions returned by the factory function: renderValue, resize, and getGlobe. We can therefore use the getGlobe method available from that object to retrieve the actual controller. // gio.js function get_gio(id){ var widget = HTMLWidgets.find(&quot;#&quot; + id); var globe = widget.getGlobe(); return globe; } 17.3.3 Handle Data We can now turn the attention to actually applying the data sent from the R server to the visualisation: the “message handler.” Registering the message handler is only relevant if shiny is running, therefore HTMLWidgets comes with a function to check whether that is the case which is useful to avoid needless errors. We can thus use it in an if statement in which all message handlers will be registered. // gio.js // check if shiny running if (HTMLWidgets.shinyMode){ // send-data message handler Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-data&#39;, function(message) { }); } What the currently empty send-data message handler should do is fetch the widget using the id sent from R with the get_gio function and then use the addData method to override the previously define arcs. // gio.js // check if shiny running if (HTMLWidgets.shinyMode){ // send-data message handler Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;send-data&#39;, function(message) { // retrieve controller var controller = get_gio(message.id); // add data controller.addData(message.data); }); } We can then build a shiny application to test the new functionality. library(gio) library(shiny) # two phoney datasets arcs1 &lt;- data.frame( e = c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;), i = c(&quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;US&quot;), v = c(100, 120, 130) ) arcs2 &lt;- data.frame( e = c(&quot;CN&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;JP&quot;), i = c(&quot;IN&quot;, &quot;JP&quot;, &quot;US&quot;), v = c(100, 120, 130) ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( selectInput( &quot;dataset&quot;, &quot;Select a dataset&quot;, choices = c(&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;) ), gioOutput(&quot;globe&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ reactive_arcs &lt;- reactive({ if(input$dataset == &quot;First&quot;) return(arcs1) return(arcs2) }) output$globe &lt;- renderGio({ gio(arcs1, i, e, v) }) observeEvent(input$dataset, { if(input$dataset == &quot;First&quot;) data &lt;- arcs1 else data &lt;- arcs2 gio_send_data(&quot;globe&quot;, data, i, e, v) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) Switching dataset with the dropdown only changes the data, it makes for a much smoother animation, even the difference in the speed at which the effect is visible on the visualisation is perceivable. 17.4 Proxy Function Before we add other similar functions we ought to pause and consider the API this provides the user. There are two points, every function such as gio_send_data, will need to accept the id and session arguments. It will be tedious to so every time, following the old “don’t repeat yourself” adage we ought to abstract this further. This can be remedied to by introducing what is often referred to as a “proxy.” A proxy is just a representation of the graph, or pragmatically, an object that contains the id of the visualisation and a shiny session. This object can subsequently be piped to other functions thereby providing not only a cleaner but also a more consistent API. #&#39; @export gio_proxy &lt;- function(id, session = shiny::getDefaultReactiveDomain()){ list(id = id, session = session) } Above we create a function called gio_proxy which takes the id of the chart one wants to build a proxy off, as well as the shiny session, they are returned in the form of a list. Next, we should adapt the gio_send_data so that it accepts the output of gioProxy instead of the id and session as done previously. In order to allow chaining such functions we also make sure it returns the proxy object. #&#39; @export gio_send_data &lt;- function(proxy, data){ message &lt;- list(id = proxy$id, data = apply(data, 1, as.list)) proxy$session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;send-data&quot;, message) return(proxy) } 17.5 Clear Data In order to actively demonstrate the advantage of the “proxy” function as well as to hammer home how such functions work, we shall build another which removes all data from the globe. In JavaScript it’s as simple as controller.clearData();. The journey starts with the R code where we create a new function that sends a message to clear the data, the message only needs to contain the id of the visualisation from which data needs to be cleared, as before it will be used to retrieve the controller from which the clearData method is available. #&#39; @export gio_clear_data &lt;- function(proxy){ message &lt;- list(id = proxy$id) proxy$session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;clear-data&quot;, message) return(proxy) } Now onto the JavaScript code to catch that message and actually clear the data from the globe. That function is very similar to what was previously shown, the only difference is the name of the message handler and the method used on the controller. // gio.js Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;clear-data&#39;, function(message) { var controller = get_gio(message.id); controller.clearData(); }); Then one can build an application to test that new function. We build a shiny application with a button to add the data to the visualisation and another to clear data from it. library(gio) library(shiny) # phoney dataset arcs &lt;- data.frame( e = c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;), i = c(&quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;US&quot;), v = c(100, 120, 130) ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( actionButton(&quot;load&quot;, &quot;Load data&quot;), actionButton(&quot;clear&quot;, &quot;Clear data&quot;), gioOutput(&quot;globe&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$globe &lt;- renderGio({ gio(arcs, i, e, v) }) observeEvent(input$load, { gio_proxy(&quot;globe&quot;) %&gt;% gio_send_data(arcs, i, e, v) }) observeEvent(input$clear, { gio_proxy(&quot;globe&quot;) %&gt;% gio_clear_data() }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 17.4: Gio with clear data proxy 17.6 Update the Widget The previous proxies defined worked for reasons unbeknownst to the author of this book. It will not work with all methods. The reason it will not work is one that is likely to occur with many other visualisation libraries. For instance, one can attempt to develop a function to dynamically change the style without having to redraw the entire globe, starting again with the R function. #&#39; @export gio_set_style &lt;- function(proxy, style){ message &lt;- list(id = proxy$id, style = style) proxy$session$sendCustomMessage(&quot;set-style&quot;, message) return(proxy) } Then adding the JavaScript handler. Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;set-style&#39;, function(message) { var controller = get_gio(message.id); controller.setStyle(message.style); }); At this stage one can try the function in a shiny application but it will not work because most such methods that change underlying aspects of a visualisation will not be reflected in real time. Gio.js, and many other libraries, will require one to explicitly ask for an update so the changes take effect. This has multiple advantages, one can stack multiple visual changes to execute them at the same time, and one can manage the load on the front-end. Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler( type = &#39;set-style&#39;, function(message) { var controller = get_gio(message.id); controller.setStyle(message.style); controller.update(); // force update the visualisation }); This forces the chart to update, applying the new style. Below we write an application that provides a dropdown to switch between two styles. library(gio) library(shiny) # two phoney datasets arcs &lt;- data.frame( e = c(&quot;US&quot;, &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;), i = c(&quot;CN&quot;, &quot;RU&quot;, &quot;US&quot;), v = c(100, 120, 130) ) ui &lt;- fluidPage( selectInput( &quot;style&quot;, &quot;Select a style&quot;, choices = c(&quot;blueInk&quot;, &quot;earlySpring&quot;) ), gioOutput(&quot;globe&quot;) ) server &lt;- function(input, output){ output$globe &lt;- renderGio({ gio(arcs1, i, e , v) }) observeEvent(input$style, { gio_proxy(&quot;globe&quot;) %&gt;% gio_set_style(input$style) }) } shinyApp(ui, server) FIGURE 17.5: Gio with dynamic style "],["v8.html", "Chapter 18 The V8 Engine 18.1 Installation 18.2 Basics 18.3 External Libraries 18.4 Npm Packages 18.5 Use in Packages", " Chapter 18 The V8 Engine V8 is an R interface to Google’s open source JavaScript engine of the same name, it powers Google Chrome, node.js and many other things. It is the last integration of JavaScript with R that is covered in this book. Both the V8 package and the engine it wraps are straightforward yet amazingly powerful. 18.1 Installation First install the V8 engine itself, instructions to do so are well detailed on V8’s README and below. On Debian or Ubuntu use the code below from the terminal to install libv8. sudo apt-get install -y libv8-dev On Centos install v8-devel, which requires the EPEL tools. sudo yum install epel-release sudo yum install v8-devel On Mac OS use Homebrew. brew install v8 Then install the R package from CRAN. install.packages(&quot;V8&quot;) 18.2 Basics V8 provides a reference class provided via the R6 (Chang 2019) package, this pertains to object-oriented programming, hence it might look unconventional to many R users. It’s nonetheless easy to grasp. If one wants to learn more about the R6’s reference class system Hadley Wickham has a very good chapter on it in his Advanced R book. Let’s explore the basic functionalities of the package. First, load the library and use the function v8 to instantiate a class, this effectively returns an execution environment, every such environment is independent of another. library(V8) #&gt; Using V8 engine 6.8.275.32-node.55 engine &lt;- v8() The eval method allows running JavaScript code from R. engine$eval(&quot;var x = 3 + 4;&quot;) # this is evaluated in R engine$eval(&quot;x&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;7&quot; Two observations on the above snippet of code. First, the variable we got back in R is a character vector when it should have been either an integer or a numeric. This is because we used the eval method which returns what is printed in the v8 console, get is more appropriate; it converts the output to its appropriate R equivalent. # retrieve the previously created variable (x &lt;- engine$get(&quot;x&quot;)) #&gt; [1] 7 class(x) #&gt; [1] &quot;integer&quot; Second, while creating a scalar with eval(\"var x = 1;\") appears painless, imagine if you will the horror of having to convert a data frame to a JavaScript array via jsonlite then flatten it to character string so it can be used with the eval method. Horrid. Thankfully V8 comes with a method assign, complimentary to get, which declares R objects as JavaScript variables. It takes two arguments, first the name of the variable to create, second the object to assign to it. # assign and retrieve a data.frame engine$assign(&quot;vehicles&quot;, cars[1:3, ]) engine$get(&quot;vehicles&quot;) #&gt; speed dist #&gt; 1 4 2 #&gt; 2 4 10 #&gt; 3 7 4 All of the conversion is handled by V8 internally with jsonlite as demonstrated in the previous chapter. We can confirm that the data frame was converted to a list rowwise; using JSON.stringify to display how the object is stored in V8. cat(engine$eval(&quot;JSON.stringify(vehicles, null, 2);&quot;)) #&gt; [ #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 4, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 2 #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 4, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 10 #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;speed&quot;: 7, #&gt; &quot;dist&quot;: 4 #&gt; } #&gt; ] However this reveals a tedious cyclical loop: 1) creating an object in JavaScript to 2) run a function on the aforementioned object 3) get the results back in R, and repeat. So V8 also allows calling JavaScript functions on R objects directly with the call method and obtain the results back in R. engine$eval(&quot;new Date();&quot;) # using eval #&gt; [1] &quot;Sun Oct 18 2020 18:36:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)&quot; engine$call(&quot;Date&quot;, Sys.Date()) # using call #&gt; [1] &quot;Sun Oct 18 2020 18:36:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)&quot; Finally, one can run code interactively rather than as strings by calling the console from the engine with engine$console() you can then exit the console by typing exit or hitting the ESC key. 18.3 External Libraries V8 is actually quite bare in and of itself, there is for instance no functionalities built-in to read or write files from disk, it thus becomes truly interesting when you can use it JavaScript libraries. We’ll demonstrate this using fuse.js a fuzzy-search library. The very first step of integrating any external library is to look at the code, often examples, to grasp an idea of what is to be achieved from R. Below is an example from the official documentation. First, an array of two books is defined, this is later used to test the search. Then another array of options is defined, this should at the very least include the key(s) that should be searched, here it is set to search through the title and authors. Then, the fuse object is initialised based on the array of books and the options. Finally, the search method is used to retrieve all books, the title or author of which, partially match the term tion. // books to search through var books = [{ &#39;ISBN&#39;: &#39;A&#39;, &#39;title&#39;: &quot;Old Man&#39;s War&quot;, &#39;author&#39;: &#39;John Scalzi&#39; }, { &#39;ISBN&#39;: &#39;B&#39;, &#39;title&#39;: &#39;The Lock Artist&#39;, &#39;author&#39;: &#39;Steve Hamilton&#39; }] const options = { // Search in `author` and in `title` array keys: [&#39;author&#39;, &#39;title&#39;] } // initialise const fuse = new Fuse(books, options) // search &#39;tion&#39; in authors and titles const result = fuse.search(&#39;tion&#39;) With some understanding of what is to be reproduced in R we can import the library with the source method which takes a file argument that will accept a path or URL to a JavaScript file to source, below we use the handy CDN (Content Delivery Network) so as to avoid downloading a file. uri &lt;- paste0( &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/&quot;, &quot;libs/fuse.js/3.4.6/fuse.min.js&quot; ) engine$source(uri) #&gt; [1] &quot;true&quot; You can think of it as using the script tag in HTML to source (src) said file from disk or CDN. &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&#39;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/.../fuse.min.js&#39;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Now onto replicating the array (list) which we want to search through, the books object used in a previous example. As already observed this is in essence how V8 stores data frames in the environment. Below we define a data frame of books that looks similar and load it into the engine. books &lt;- data.frame( title = c( &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, &quot;Black Swan&quot;, &quot;Common Sense&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; ), id = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) ) engine$assign(&quot;books&quot;, books) Then again we can make sure that the data frame was turned into a rowwise JSON object. cat(engine$eval(&quot;JSON.stringify(books, null, 2);&quot;)) #&gt; [ #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, #&gt; &quot;id&quot;: &quot;a&quot; #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Black Swan&quot;, #&gt; &quot;id&quot;: &quot;b&quot; #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Common Sense&quot;, #&gt; &quot;id&quot;: &quot;c&quot; #&gt; }, #&gt; { #&gt; &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, #&gt; &quot;id&quot;: &quot;d&quot; #&gt; } #&gt; ] Now we can define options for the search, we don’t get into the details of fuse.js here as this is not the purpose of this book, you can read more about the options in the examples section of the site. We can mimic the format of the JSON options shown on the website with a simple list and assign that to a new variable in the engine. Note that we wrap the title in a list to ensure it is converted to an array of length 1: list(\"title\") should be converted to a [\"title\"] array and not a \"title\" scalar. // JavaScript var options = { keys: [&#39;title&#39;], id: &#39;id&#39; } # R options &lt;- list( keys = list(&quot;title&quot;), id = &quot;id&quot; ) engine$assign(&quot;options&quot;, options) Then we can finish the second step of the online examples, instantiate a fuse.js object with the books and options objects then make a search the result of which is assigned to an object which is retrieved in R with get. engine$eval(&quot;var fuse = new Fuse(books, options)&quot;) engine$eval(&quot;var results = fuse.search(&#39;sense&#39;)&quot;) engine$get(&quot;results&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;d&quot; &quot;c&quot; A search for “sense” returns a vector of ids where the term “sense” was found; c and d or the books Common Sense, Sense and Sensibility. We could perhaps make that last code simpler using the call method. engine$call(&quot;fuse.search&quot;, &quot;sense&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;d&quot; &quot;c&quot; 18.4 Npm Packages We can also use npm packages, though not all will work. Npm is node’s Package Manager, or in a sense Node’s equivalent of CRAN. To use npm packages we need browserify, a node library to bundle all dependencies of an npm package into a single file which can subsequently be imported in V8. Browserify is itself an npm package and there requires node and npm installed. The reason browserify is required is that the JavaScript code written for node is different from that which should be written for web browsers, therefore importing a Javascript file built with node.js in a browser may not work: browserify will translate node.js code (where necessary) into JavaScript code the browser can run. You can install browserify globally with the following the g flag. Install node.js and type the following the terminal. npm install -g browserify We can now “browserify” an npm package. To demonstrate we will use ms which converts various time formats to milliseconds. First we install the npm package. npm install ms Then we browserify it. From the terminal, the first line creates a file called in.js which contains global.ms = require('ms'); we then call browserify on that file specifying ms.js as output file. The require function in JavaScript is used to import files, require('ms') imports ms.js, it’s to some extend like source(\"ms.R\"). echo &quot;global.ms = require(&#39;ms&#39;);&quot; &gt; in.js browserify in.js -o ms.js We can now source ms.js with v8, before we do so we ought to look at example code to see what has to be reproduced using V8. Luckily the library is very straightforward: it includes a single function for all conversions, e.g.: ms('2 days') to convert 2 days in milliseconds. library(V8) ms &lt;- v8() ms$source(&quot;ms.js&quot;) Then using the library simply consists of using eval or preferably call (for cleaner code and data interpretation to R). ms$eval(&quot;ms(&#39;2 days&#39;)&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;172800000&quot; ms$call(&quot;ms&quot;, &quot;2s&quot;) # 2 seconds #&gt; [1] 2000 18.5 Use in Packages In this section we detail how one should go about using V8 in an R package, if you are not familiar with package development you can skip ahead. We start by creating a package called “ms” that will hold functionalities we explored in the previous section on npm packages. usethis::create_package(&#39;ms&#39;) The package is going to rely on V8 so it needs to be added under Imports in the DESCRIPTION file, then again this can be done with usethis as shown below. # add V8 to DESCRIPTION usethis::use_package(&quot;V8&quot;) The package should also include the external library ms.js browserified from the npm package which should be placed it in the inst directory. Create it and place the ms.js file within the latter. dir.create(&quot;inst&quot;) As explored, the core of the V8 package is the execution environment(s) that are spawned using the v8 function. One could perhaps provide a function that returns the object created by v8 but it would not be convenient: this function would need to be called explicitly by the users of the package and the output of it would need to be passed to every subsequent functions. Thankfully there is a better way. Instead we can use the function .onLoad, to create the execution environment and import the dependency when the package is loaded by the user. You can read more about this function in Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book. This is in effect very similar to how the Python integration of R, reticulate (Ushey, Allaire, and Tang 2020) is used in packages. This function is often placed in a zzz.R file. # zzz.R ms &lt;- NULL .onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname){ ms &lt;&lt;- V8::v8() } At this stage the package’s directory structure should look similar to the tree below. . ├── DESCRIPTION ├── NAMESPACE ├── R │ └── zzz.R └── inst └── ms.js Now the dependency can be sourced in the .onLoad function. We can locate the files in the inst directory with the system.file function. # zzz.R ms &lt;- NULL .onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname){ ms &lt;&lt;- V8::v8() # locate dependency file dep &lt;- system.file(&quot;ms.js&quot;, package = &quot;ms&quot;) ms$source(dep) } We can then create a to_ms function, it will have access the ms object we instantiated in .onLoad. #&#39; @export to_ms &lt;- function(string){ ms$call(&quot;ms&quot;, string) } After running devtools::document() and installing the package with devtools::install() it’s ready to used. ms::to_ms(&quot;10 hrs&quot;) #&gt; [1] 36000000 References "],["v8-ml.html", "Chapter 19 Exercise - Machine Learning 19.1 Dependency 19.2 Simple Regression 19.3 Managing JavaScript 19.4 Trasnpiling 19.5 Minification 19.6 Bundling 19.7 Decoupling 19.8 NPM", " Chapter 19 Exercise - Machine Learning In this chapter we build a package that, via V8, wraps ml.js, a library which brings machine learning to JavaScript. It covers quite a few models, in this chapter we only include one: the linear regression. This is an interesting example because it reveals some proceedings that one is likely to run into when creating packages using V8. const x = [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5]; const y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]; const regression = new ml.SimpleLinearRegression(x, y); 19.1 Dependency We start by creating a package and add the V8 package as dependency. usethis::create_package(&quot;ml&quot;) usethis::use_package(&quot;V8&quot;) Then we create the inst directory in which we place the ml.js file downloaded from the CDN. dir.create(&quot;inst&quot;) download.file( &quot;https://www.lactame.com/lib/ml/4.0.0/ml.min.js&quot;, &quot;inst/ml.min.js&quot; ) With the dependency downloaded one can start working on the R code. First, a new V8 context needs to be created and the ml.js file need to be imported in it. # zzz.R ml &lt;- NULL .onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname){ ml &lt;&lt;- V8::v8() mljs &lt;- system.file(&quot;ml.min.js&quot;, package = &quot;ml&quot;) ml$source(mljs) } 19.2 Simple Regression First model we make available is the “simple linear regression”, which consists of a simple function that takes two arrays. We can thus create a function that takes two vectors, x, and y, and runs the regression. #&#39; @export ml_simple_lm &lt;- function(y, x){ # assign x and y ml$assign(&quot;x&quot;, x) ml$assign(&quot;y&quot;, y) # run regression ml$eval(&quot;var regression = new ML.SimpleLinearRegression(x, y);&quot;) # return results ml$get(&quot;regression&quot;) } Then we can document and load the model to the function. ml_simple_lm(cars$speed, cars$dist) ## $name ## [1] &quot;simpleLinearRegression&quot; ## ## $slope ## [1] 0.1655676 ## ## $intercept ## [1] 8.283906 This works but has a few issues, namely running two or more regression internally will override the variable regression in the V8 context. Let us demonstrate by implementing a function to predict. #&#39; @export ml_predict &lt;- function(x){ ml$call(&quot;regression.predict&quot;, x) } We then document and load the functions to then run two regressions in a row and observe the issue. Unlike R the model we created only exists in JavaScript, unlike the lm, the function ml_simple_lm does not return the model. Therefore, ml_simple_lm does not distinguish between models, unlike predict which takes the model as first argument and runs the prediction on it. This implementation of ml.js is indeed very dangerous. # first model ml_simple_lm(cars$speed, cars$dist) ml_predict(15) ## 25.18405 # overrides model ml_simple_lm(1:10, runif(10)) # produces different predictions ml_predict(15) ## 10.76742 The package ml currently under construction should emulate R in that respect, the ml_simple_lm should return the model which should be usable with the predict function. In order to do we are going to need to track regressions internally in V8 so the ml_simple_lm return a proxy of the model that predict can use to predict on the intended model. In order to track and store regressions internally we are going to declare an empty array when the package is loaded. # zzz.R ml &lt;- NULL .onLoad &lt;- function(libname, pkgname){ ml &lt;&lt;- V8::v8() mljs &lt;- system.file(&quot;ml.min.js&quot;, package = &quot;ml&quot;) ml$source(mljs) ml$eval(&quot;var regressions = [];&quot;) } Then, one can track regressions by creating an R object which is incremented every time ml_simple_lm runs, this can be used as variable name in the JavaScript regressions array declare in .onLoad. This variable name must be stored in the object we intend to return so the predict method we will create later on can access the model and run predictions. Finally, in order to declare a new method on the predict function we need to return an object bearing a unique class, below we use mlSimpleRegression. counter &lt;- new.env(parent = emptyenv()) counter$regressions &lt;- 0 #&#39; @export ml_simple_lm &lt;- function(y, x){ counter$regressions &lt;- counter$regressions + 1 # assign variables ml$assign(&quot;x&quot;, x) ml$assign(&quot;y&quot;, y) # address address &lt;- paste0(&quot;regressions[&#39;&quot;, counter$regressions, &quot;&#39;]&quot;) # create regression code &lt;- paste0( address, &quot; = new ML.SimpleLinearRegression(x, y);&quot; ) ml$eval(code) # retrieve and append address regression &lt;- ml$get(address) regression$address &lt;- address # create object of new class structure( regression, class = c(&quot;mlSimpleRegression&quot;, class(regression)) ) } Then on can implement the predict method for mlSimpleRegression. The function uses the address of the model to run the JavaScript predict method on that object. #&#39; @export predict.mlSimpleRegression &lt;- function(object, newdata, ...){ code &lt;- paste0(object$address, &quot;.predict&quot;) ml$call(code, newdata) } We can then build and load the package to it in action. library(ml) # first model model_cars &lt;- ml_simple_lm(cars$speed, cars$dist) # second model model_random &lt;- ml_simple_lm(1:10, runif(10)) predict(model_random, 15) #&gt; [1] 10.11191 predict(model_cars, 15) #&gt; [1] 10.76742 19.3 Managing JavaScript Thus far all of the JavaScript code written in this book was placed directly in the file that was imported in the front-end. While this works absolutely fine for the smaller projects it is bound to lead to huge headaches for the larger ones. It’s the same problem one faces when writing R code. While a small script of 300 lines of code will do the job a large script of 10,000 lines is unmanageable. Therefore when tackling larger projects the R programmer will turn to solutions that enforces a certain file structure and provides utilities to easily manage those files. Some of these solutions may include the drake package (Landau 2020a), or the targets package (Landau 2020b) both of which provide tools to manage workflows and pipelines. Another method often used is to build the project as an R package, thereby enforcing a structure as well as enabling, reproducibility, unit tests, and more. The above mentioned issues are also a concern in JavaScript though here one has to be concerned with other things as well. JavaScript, like R is a constantly evolving language but while R code written on version 4.0.0 will likely run absolutely fine on version 3.0.0 it is not the case for JavaScript. As the language evolves and changes web browsers have to keep up to support any new features the language provides. Therefore JavaScript code that is written on the latest version may not run on all browsers, also consider that even if the latest version of Chrome and Firefox tend to support the latest JavaScript version users who visit your shiny applications or use your htmlwidgets may not have their browsers up to date. In JavaScript, code (mis)management might be exacerbated by the fact that it often relies on other files such as CSS, JSON, images, and more. Making it even more difficult to build robust projects. Move an image or remove a CSS file and an entire JavaScript project can be broken. Also, in JavaScript code size matters: the smaller the file the faster it will load in the browser. This is achieved with a process called “minification,” which consists in remove all unnecessary characters such as spaces (but not limited to) from a JavaScript file to obtain a “minified” version of it that fits on a single line and which is smaller in size. This involves yet another process as humans cannot read or write minified code: try removing all line breaks and spaces from your R scripts if you think otherwise. Finally, since R is rather strict packages enforce a certain structure, JavaScript does not come with such restrictions off the shelf. It’s therefore even more tempting for the developer to take shortcuts and make a mess of their projects. Combine all of the above and software that involves JavaScript can quickly become poorly structured and cumbersome. Moreover trying to consider all these potential issues as one programs is unsustainable as it greatly increases the cognitive load and ultimately distracts from writing code itself, it’s just too much to consider. Thankfully some tools have been invented over the years to help JavaScript developers manage all of these matters. These technologies each differ from one another somewhat, they each have their pros and cons, but all have the same goal: making JavaScript projects more manageable. Grunt describes itself as a “the JavaScript task runner,” and will carry minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, and more. There is also Parcel a web application bundler that will minify, bundle, (and more) JavaScript code. However, the one we shall use in this part of the book is webpack, as it is very similar to Grunt and is one of the most popular. 19.4 Trasnpiling As new functionalities are made available in JavaScript with every new version web browser have to keep pace and support running said functionalities. First, this is not always the case although major web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari generally do a decent job of doing so one can never count on the clients using those products to do the updates. Imagine building a large htmlwidgets for a client only to discover that for IT security reasons all their company laptops run a certain version of a web browser that does not support key functionalities the widget relies upon. Ensuring that the JavaScript code can run on most browsers is no trivial task. The best way to do so is not to write outdated JavaScript code that all browsers should support, the solution is actually to use a Babel, a transpiler that will convert “ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript.” This way one can use the latest JavaScript, even before browsers officially support it, transpile it with Babel to obtain a JavaScript file that will run on any browser that support ECMAScript 2015 (JavaScript version released in 2015). 19.5 Minification Browser always need to load the files necessary to render a webpage, be it a static website, a shiny application, or a standalone widget. Loading those files can take critical time and make the loading of a web application slow. Therefore it is good practice to reduce the size of those files. This includes compressing images so they are smaller in size and load faster but also “minifying” CSS and JavaScript code. When writing code use humans like to use comprehensible variable names, line breaks, and spaces and other things that help make things clear and readable. Machines however do not need much of that, as long as the code is valid it will run. // original code let number = 41; function hello(my_variable){ let total = number + 1; console.log(total); } Minification is the process of removing all of the “syntactic sugar” that is unnecessary to obtain JavaScript that fits in a single line and makes for a smaller file. See the example given here where the code above is minified to obtain the code below, note that even some variable names have changed to be shorter. // minified let number=41;function hello(e){let l=number+1;console.log(l)} 19.6 Bundling Managing the structure of JavaScript projects can be tricky. One does not want to place 2,000 lines of code in a single line but splitting JavaScript code across file is difficult. While writing an R package one is free to organise the functions in different files as their content (functions, data, etc.) is ultimately loaded into the global environment with library by the user of the package. In JavaScript one does not have the luxury of writing code across different files to then call library() in the web browser so all the functions written are available. In this paradigm individual files have to be loaded separately in the browser (as shown below). &lt;script src=&quot;utils.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; While this may be fine for two or three files it quickly goes out of hand as one has to remember to import those in the correct order, in the above example variables declared in main.js cannot be used in utils.js, unless we change the order of the import. It’s therefore essential to use tools that allow writing JavaScript in different files, manage the dependencies between these files, then “bundle” those correctly into one or more files destined to be imported in the browser. 19.7 Decoupling One thing that might become apparent with previous sections is the idea of decoupling the final code that makes it into the web browser from the code we write. It is thanks to this decoupling that we can write clear JavaScript on the latest version across multiple files to then run the various processes of transpiling, bundling, and minifying to obtain code that is more efficient and robust for the browser. This may appear like a lot to manage, thankfully we can use the aforementioned webpack software to take care of all these procedures for us. There is nonetheless a gentle learning curve to make use of it. 19.8 NPM Another new piece of software that one needs to be introduced to is Node’s Package Manager, here henceforth referred to as NPM. As indicated by the name it’s a package manager for Node.js, or translated for the R user it’s Node.js version of CRAN. One first major difference is that while CRAN performs very rigorous and strict check on any package submitted NPM does not, one can publish almost anything. It has nonetheless greatly changed the way one manages dependencies in JavaScript. Notice how every dependency that were used in this book thus far had to be either imported from the CDN or downloaded manually. References "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 20 Conclusion 20.1 Performances 20.2 Road Ahead", " Chapter 20 Conclusion The book covered a few topics and introduced a lot of concepts probably new to many, these are sometimes difficult to fully understand at first and will likely require some more exploring. So here, we wrap up with some heartening thoughts to encourage the reader to persevere as much of what was covered in the book requires practice to be fully comprehended. 20.1 Performances As mentioned in the opening of this book some of the code presented is not entirely optimal as we need to make use of R as much as possible to limit any confusion caused by the fresh-to-the-eyes JavaScript code. In places, this involves making use of R where it is in fact not needed, namely within shiny applications where sometimes data is sent from the front end to R, only to be sent back to JavaScript again. For instance, when the click of a button triggers something in the shiny UI but uses the server as an intermediary, oftentimes it is not necessary to involve the server. This, though has little impact on performances in most cases, can be improved upon by not involving R in the process, handling everything in the front-end with JavaScript but this was judged outside the scope of the book as it focuses on interactions between the two languages. Nonetheless, somewhat interestingly, the book covered all the code necessary to do so, only not in the same section or chapter. It might therefore take some practice to make the connection. // toggle an input at the click of a button $(&#39;#button&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function(){ $(&#39;#input&#39;).toggle(); }); 20.2 Road Ahead Practice makes perfect: the best way to become at ease with the learnings of the book is probably to attempt to put them into practice. In addition to finishing the projects used as examples in this book, below are some ideas of great JavaScript library that are yet to be integrated with R, make for great practice and would great benefit the community. 20.2.1 Computation chance.js - random generator currency.js - helpers to work with currencies 20.2.2 Shiny micromodal.js - tiny, dependency-free javascript library for creating accessible modal dialogs hotkeys - capture keyboard inputs handtrack.js - realtime hand detection annyang - speech Recognition library 20.2.3 htmlwidgets chart.js - simple yet flexible JavaScript charting cytoscape.js - network theory library for visualisation and analysis Toast UI charts - easy way to draw various and essential charts amcharts - library for all your data visualization needs Moreover, the book did obviously not cover everything that can be done with JavaScript, much more is possible. Perhaps this book entices the reader to go a step further and become more familiar with JavaScript.
